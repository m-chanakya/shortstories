A letter signed by Satan, believed to be written by Mark Twain to the Editor of Harper's Weekly. The writer says they should be done with this frivolous talk. He continues that the American Board accepts contributions from him, so why not Mr. Rockefeller. He states that three-fourths of the support of charities is conscience-money, so then what does the term mean in regards to Mr. Rockefeller's gift. He said the Board is mainly financed by conscience-money and crimes, so should the board turn down these.
He continues that Mr. Rockefeller's contribution is tainted by perjury. but every rich man in the city perjures themselves before the tax board. He said iff there isn't one, he'll pay the editor. He concludes by saying contributions from perjurers is money of sin, and since they accept his money, why not Mr. Rockefellers, who is as good as his.
