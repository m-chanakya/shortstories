Once there was a plague among animals. Many died and those who lived were ill, and cared about neither food nor drink. The Lion decided to call a council and gathered all the animals. He said the gods must have sent this plague as a punishment and the most guilty of us should be sacrificed. He continued saying that everyone should confess their sins, and the most guilty would be decided. He confessed that he ate many sheep, goats, bulls, stags, and even a shepherd. The Fox said those were good deeds. The animals applauded. The rest of the savage beasts confessed similar deeds. They were all excused. Then, the Ass admitted to eating the grass of a priest's field out of hunger. The beasts immediately declared him the most guilty. He was sacrificed right there without an altar. The week are made to suffer for the misdeeds of the powerful.
