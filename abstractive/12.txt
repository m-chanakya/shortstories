A letter was written from Saint Nicholas to Susy Clemens. He says that he read all her letters and he had some trouble understanding one request. He wants to know if she wanted a trunk full of doll's clothes.
So he tells her he will call and ask, and she must tell him yes or no. If yes, she must give him detailed instructions about the color and contents. He then said he will bring the trunk in the chimney and everyone is to close all the doors to the hall where the chimney is and wait. He asks that if his boat leaves a mark that it should be left there as a reminder that he was there. He asks that whenever she looks at it she should remember that she is a good little girl.
