Once six blind men stood at the side of the road. They heard an elephant was being driven down. They asked if they might see him as they never had heard of one before. They thought by touching the elephant they would understand what kind of animal he was. The first touched the elephant's side and thought he was like a wall. The second touched the elephant's tusk and disagreed saying he was like a spear. The third said he was like a snake touching the elephant's trunk. The fourth said he was like a tree as he held the elephant's legs. The fifth held the elephant's ear and thought he was like a fan. The sixth called them all foolish saying he was like a rope as he held the tail. The six men fought, each believing they were right. People who have eyes something act just as foolishly.
