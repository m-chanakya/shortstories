Once there was a cat who was watchful, the mice were scared. The cat seemed to be everywhere at once ready to pounce. The mice kept to their dens. The cat devised a plan. He pretended to be hanging like he was dead. The mice saw him and celebrated his death. Before they could recover from this feeling the cat caught three or four. Now the mice were more strict. The cat came up with another plan. He covered himself in flour and laid down in the flour bin with one eye open. The mice began to come out when an experienced rat told them to take care as he thought the lump in the flour looks like the cat. The wise do not let themselves be tricked a second time.
