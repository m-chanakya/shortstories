A young mouse who had never seen the world, ventured out for the first time. He reported back and told his mother about what he saw. He said he was strolling when he turned a corner and saw two creatures. One was kind and gracious, while the other was monsterous. The latter had raw meat on his head and neck, and he walked tearing up the ground, and beating his arms savagely. When this creature saw the young mouse, he roared and frightened him. The young mouse was dissapointed that he could befriend the nice looking creature because of this. This creature was gentle, meek and very modest with bright eyes. When this creature saw the mouse, he waved his tail at him. He about to speak when the monster roared. The Mother Mouse told her son that the gentle creature was a cat and he hates and eats mice, and the other was bird. She told him to never judge by looks.
