There was once a wise old Cock who flew into a tree to roost. Before he could rest, his eyes caught a glimpse of the Fox below. The Fox said he had wonderful news, that all the animals agreed to live in peace from now on forever. He told the Cock that he could not wait to embrace him and to come down and celebrate. The Cock said he was delighted in an absent way, looking far off. The Fox asked him what he saw. The Cock said the dogs are coming and they are his friends now. The Fox did not wait to hear more, he ran. The Cock asked him why he was running, the Fox said they might not have heard the news, and made an excuse. The Cock smiled as he had outwitted the trickster.
