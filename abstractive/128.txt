One evening, a government clerk, Ivan Dmitritch Tchervyakov was watching an opera. Suddenly, he sneezed. He looked around to see if anyone was disturbed. He saw an old man in front of him wiping his bald head and muttering. It was Brizzhalov, a civilian general. Ivan thought he should apologize for splattering him. He did so and Brizzhalov seemed to dismiss him, saying it as fine and he had forgotten it. Ivan was not convinced. He went home and told his wife, who urged him to go apologise. He explained how he did but Brizzhalov did not take it well. The next day, Ivan went to the general's reception. The general was interviewing petitioners, and reached Ivan. Ivan apologised again. Brizzhalov said what nonsense. Ivan thought he was still angry. When the general was leaving, Ivan tried to apologise again. The general asked why Ivan was making fun of him by doing this. He decided to go meet him the next day in person, where he again assured him it was an accident and apologised. The general yelled at him to be off angrily. Ivan's stomach gave away. He saw nothing, heard nothing, reached home, he laid down on the sofa and died.
