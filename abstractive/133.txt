An A.D.T Kid delivered a rush message stopped in front of a show window containing a picture of James J. Jeffries and began to bawl. A man was passing along, he saw the kid and thought it a chance to be nice. He asked the kid why he was crying. The kid explained that he thought he had no chance of growing up to be like Jeffries. The man replied saying why do you want to be like Jeffries. It's also a worthy life to be well-loved and respected on the outskirts and proceeded to describe his various odd acheivements. The kid after hearing this stopped crying and started playing "Wood Tag". Thus, as the twig is bent the tree is inclined.
