Genghis Khan was a great king and warrior. One morning he was home from the wards, and he rode out into the woods to hunt. On his wrist sat his hawk. In those days, they were trained to hunt. Towards the evening, the king started for home. As he knew all the paths, he took the longer road home. He was very thristy and his pet hawk had flown home. He saw some water trickling down. In the wet season, it would have poured, but as it was hot it only fell one drop at a time. He took a cup from his bag. He held the cup to catch the drops. Once it was nearly full, he was about to drink it. It was knocked from his hands by the hawk. He tried again and again. Once again, he filled the cup, and drew his sword. He warned his bird it was the last time. The hawk knocked it down, and Khan killed the bird. The cup was beyond reach, so he climbed the bank to the origin. He reached it and saw a dead very poisonous snake in the pool of water. The king thought only of his poor bird that he had killed. He vowed to never do anything in anger.
