There was an outcry at the door of the King's great hall. A strong voice shouted that he will come in and he must see the false king. The king let him come in. A man in armour stood in front of the throne. He was weary, afraid and mostly angry. He drew a chain with a blue stone at the end from his breast and threw it on the steps of the throne. He turned to leave, but the king told him to stay. Then, he asked whose the jewel was. The man explained that it was the king's jewel, that an old servant of his gave him. The servant told the man that the jewel was the stone of truth, perfect and priceless. He was told to protect the stone with his life, which he did. Then he noticed a flaw in the stone and realised it wasn't the stone of truth. The king asked him for the stone. The man said it lies at his feet where he threw it. The king explained that the jewel was him, as it taught him so much. The man then looked into the jewel for a flaw, but all he saw was himself.
