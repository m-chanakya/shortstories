A Flea, a Grasshopper and a Leap-frog wanted to see who could jump the highest. They invited everyone. The King said he would give his daughter to the one who could jump the highest. The Flea stepped forward first. He had exquisite manners and noble blood. The Grasshopper stepped forward next, he was from an ancient family and thought he was good enough to marry a Princess. The Leap-frog said nothing. A housedog sniffed him and it was confessed that the Leap-frog was from a good family. An old councillor said the Leap-frog was a prophet. The contest started. The Flea jumped so high that no one could see him, so it was declared he didn't jump at all. The Grasshopper jumped only half as high, but he did it into the King's face. It was declared ill-mannered. The Leap-frog jumped into the lap of the Princess who was sitting close by. The King said there was nothing above his daughter, and the frog understood this as he was wise. So the Leap=frog one. The Flea said the world seldom rewards merit. The Grasshopper said that a fine exterior is everything, and began his song that became this story.
