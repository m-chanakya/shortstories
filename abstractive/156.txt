A little mouse told his mother that the people of their house must be so kind. His mother replied that they sure are but he shouldn't go above ground without her as they will catch him. The little mouse, Greywhiskers, thought he could take care of himself. So, when his mother was sleeping, he went above ground and ate some of cake that was left out. He felt guilty when his mother called and ran back. She took him up to the pantry, saw the hole in the cake and said some mouse must have been here before. The next day, the little mouse snuck up again, and smelled toasted cheese, went towards it and got stuck in a trap. The cook, who set the trap, lifted it and called a girl, Ethel, to see the thief who ate her cake. On hearing the cook intended to drown him, Ethel, teared up. She asked the mouse if he knew he was stealing, the mouse said no. Ethel let him go. He ran home and his mother comforted him and asked him to never disobey her again.
