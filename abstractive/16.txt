There was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit. It was delciate and fine. The buttons shone like stars, and the man was pleased with it beyond measure. He wanted to wear it everywhere as he liked it so much. He wanted to show it all sorts of people. He thought of all the places he's been and imagined being there in the suit. His mother told him that he could not as it was his special suit that he must save for special ocassions. She protected the buttons with tissue paper, and the rest with guards. He hated it but he couldn't do anything. He took it off, put it away and thought about wearing it with no tissue paper or guards, not caring about a thing.
