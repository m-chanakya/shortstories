There was once a king named Dionysius. He was cruel and unjust and everyone hated him. He lived in constant fear that someone would kill him. He lived in a palace and had many costly things. He was waited upon by servants. One day his friend, Damocles remarked that it would be great to be him, as he had everyone one could wish for. Dionysius asked him to change places with him, and they agreed for one day. The next day, Damocles was led into the palace. The servents were told to treat him as their master. He enjoyed the rich foods, the flowers, the perfumes and music. He rested on the soft cushions. He felt so happy. He raised his eyes towards the ceiling and saw a sword hanging from a single horse-hair. He was scared that the hair might break. Dionysius asked him what was wrong. Damocles explained. Dionysius replied saying that, indeed, the sword might fall at any moment and this is how he feels all the time. Damocles wanted to leave and understood that the rich and powerful are not always happy. He never wanted to change places with the king again.
