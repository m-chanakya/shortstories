There were kitten's who had fur coats and played in the dust. One day their mother, Tabhitha, was expecting friends. She fetched the kittens and washed and dressed them before company arrived. She scrubbed Moppet's face, brushed Mittens' fur, and combed Tom Kitten's tails and whiskers. She dressed them all. Tom was fat, so his buttons burst off, and his mother sewed them on again. When they were ready, Tabitha put them in the garden, out of the way. She told them to walk on their hind legs, keep clean and stay away from the dirty ashpit, and the Puddle-ducks. Moppet and Mittens walked unsteadily and fell. They had smears on their clothes. They then climbed the wall. Doing his, Moppet's tucker fell down into the road. Tom couldn't jump, he came slowly losing many buttons. His clothes were in pieces when he reached the top. When the others tried to pull him up, his hat fell and the rest of his buttons burst. The Puddle-ducks came. Rebeccah and Jemima picked up the hat and tucker and put them on. Mittens laughed and fell of the wall. Moppet and Tom after her. The rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down. Moppet asked Drake Puddle-duck to come help dress Tom, but Drake took the clothes and left. Tabitha came and saw her children had no clothes. She smacked them and sent them upstairs saying they were not fit to be seen. She told her friends they had the measles. Their noises from upstairs disturbed the party. The ducks lost the clothes in the pond, and were still looking for them.
