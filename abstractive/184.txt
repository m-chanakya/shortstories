A Town Mouse visted his relative in the Country for lunch. The Country Mouse served food which the Town Mouse barely ate, picking at it to be polite. After the meal, Town Mouse talked about her life in the city. They went to bed after, and Country Mouse dreamt she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries of city life. The next day, Country Mouse asked Town Mouse if she could go home with her. She agreed, and they soon reached the mansion where Town Mouse lived. Country Mouse was very impressed by the food they found there. Just as Country Mouse was about to start eating, they heard the Cat. They hid in fear for a long while and when they came back, the servants were clearing the table followed by the Dog. The Country Mouse went back to get her things and left. She said she prefers the plain food and simple life with the peace and security that goes with it.
