There was a war between the Swedes and the Danes. The war ended and the Swedes were defeated. A wounded Danish soldier was about to drink water when he heard a cry for water from an injured Swede. As we went up to the Swede to help him, the Swede shot him. The shot was not fatal. The Dane however did not punish him and still gave him water. When the king of Danes asked why he had forgiven a man who had tried to kill him, the soldier told him he couldn't harm a wounded man. The king was pleased and knighted the soldier.
