King Henry had a son named William, whom he loved, and everyone hoped to see as King someday. One summar the Prince went with the King to France. He won everyone's love there too. When they had to go back, the King left earlier in the day, and the Prince was to leave at night as he could not tear himself away. Then him and his company boarded the ship of white sails and masts, built for this occasion. The seas were smooth, winds fair, no danger seemed to be about. Everyone was merry and glad aboard the ship. Suddenly in the night, the ship hit a rock. The Prince and some friends jumped into a small boat. They pushed away and then heard a cry. It was the Prince's sister. They went back and just went the Prince gave his sister his hand, the waves crashed into the boat and everyone went down together. Only one man survived. The King was heart-broken and joyless. It is said no one ever saw him smile again.
