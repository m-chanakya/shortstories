There was once a wolf who had very little to eat because the dogs around were watchful. He was very thin. One night the wolf came across a fat House Dog who was a little far from home, but the House Dog seemed strong so the wolf could not eat him. The Wolf complimented the dog saying he looked well-fed. The dog replied saying the wolf could too be well fed. He just has to leave the woods and follow his example. The wolf asked what he had to do. The dog said the wolf just had to chase, bark and fawn on people and they would give bits of food and kind words. The wolf imagined how happy he would be. Then he noticed the fur on the dog's neck. He asked what it was. The dog said it was the collar to which his chain was fastened. The wolf asked if he goes where he wants whenever he wants. The dog said not always. The wolf said he would not take any amount of food for the price of liberty.
