One day two men of Gotham met on a bridge. Hodge was coming from the market and Peter going to market. Hodge asked Peter where he was going. Peter said that he was going to buy sheep. Hodge asked him which way Peter intended to bring them home. Peter replied over the bridge. Hodge refused to let him. Peter argued with him. They continued to argue as if there were a hundred sheep between them. Another man of Gotham came from the market and saw his neighbours quarreling about sheep, but could see not sheep between them. He asked Peter to come help carry the sack on his shoulder to the side of the bridge. He told them to learn a lesson and he poured out all the meal in the sack into the river. He asked them to tell him how much meal was in the sack. They said none. The man then said you guys fighting about nothing have no more sense than I have meal in my sack.
