The story of the story is that many years ago I had a severe and continuous nervous breakdown tending to melancholia. In the third year of this, I went, in faith, to the best specialist in the country. He put me to bed, applied the cure and concluded that nothing was wrong with me. He advised me to live as domestic a life as possible, only have two hours of intellectual life a day, and never touch a pen, brush or pencil again. I obeyed this for three months at home and almost reached mental ruin. Using whatever intelligence I have left, and a friend, I went to work, recovering some measure of power. I wrote 'The Yellow Wall Paper' to carry out the ideal. I sent a copy to the physician, who never acknowledged it. The book is valued by alientists as good literature. It saved one woman from a similar fate. Years later, I was told the specialist admitted that he altered his treatment since reading the book. It was intended to save people from being driven crazy and it worked.
