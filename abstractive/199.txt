This is a legend amoung South American Indians. God orignally made men so they need not work, look for food, lived till they were a hundred and did not know what illness was. After time, God looked down and saw that people were not happy. They were fighting and selfish. God created work, and he it made required for them to build houses, and gather food to not suffer from the cold and hunger. God thought this was not something they could do on their own. After awhile, he looked down again, and he saw that they had formed groups and were not stealing from each other and everyone was miserable. So then God made it possibly for man to die at any time, so they value their time. When he looked down in awhile, and saw the stronger ones subdued the weaker ones, the stronger suffered from weariness of idleness and the weaker from lack of rest. Each set of men hated the other. God decided to send sickness among men, in hopes that people will have pity on those who are sick, help them and when they recover they might return the favour. But when God looked down in some time, he saw that the stronger men just made the weaker men take care of them when they are sick and no one took care of the weaker men. The sick were isolated in building and cared for without campassion and even disgust. People avoided the sick in fear of falling sick. God gave up, left the men and said let them be taught by suffering. The men lived long before they understood that everyone could be happy.
