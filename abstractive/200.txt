The Grafin's two elder sons had made deplorable marriages. The youngest, who was a black sheep, was not married yet. The Grafin tells the Baroness Sophie that viciousness keeps boys out of trouble. Sophie tries to talk intlligently. She wonders why she doesn't as her mother was a great conversationalist. The Grafin makes fun of her saying these things skip generations. Sophie brings up her daughter saying she said something clever. The Grafin suggests that Sophie's daughter Elsa should marry Wratislav, the youngest son. Sophie thinks Elsa would be miserable, but the Grafin convinces her. Three weeks later, the Grafin drops off the children at the Rodenstahls' house, and insults Elsa once more. She reminds Sophie that they are having lunch together on Thrusday. On Thrusday, Sophie is late for lunch. She bursts into the room exclaiming that Elsa ran away with the Rodenstahls' chauffeur, and that she cannot marry Wratislav now. The Grafin tells her that Elsa couldn't anyway because Wratislav left for abroad last night. On enquiring why, the Grafin tells her that conscience makes cowboys of us all. When Sophie says that she didn't know Wratislav had a conscience, the Grafin replies saying that he doesn't, and that it was other people's consciences that made him go abroad.
