Good little girls should not talk back to their teachers for everything. They should only under certain circumstances. They should not forcibly trade their rag-dolls with costly ones. They should treat the rag-dolls with kindness. They should never take their brother's chewing-gum by force. They should promise to pay for it with the money they find, as he will think it's fair. If they think they need to teach their brother's a lesson they should do it with hot water and not mud. As the hot water will cleanse the brother. If their mothers tell them to do something, they should agree even if they do not plan to do it. Since they depend on their parents for many things, they should respect their prejudices and humor their whims until it's too much. Good little girls should never sass old people unless the old people sass them first.
