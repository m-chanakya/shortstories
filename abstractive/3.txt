A letter was written by a man in answer to a young lady who invited him to a children's party. The writer firmly refused the invitation. He said that the young lady meant well but her ideas, mistaken. He went on to say that he, at his age, cannot participate in children's games, despite his respect for them. He thinks that his participation in a game where someone hits him and he is asked to guess who would result in criminality. He also explains that he cannot pretend to be a bear and crawl around. He disapproves of the Reverend being a big part of the evening and suspects him of ulterior motives. He knows that the young lady's madien aunt will help her entertain by organizing guessing games. He is sure that he will make a fool of himself here, and the children will clap. He thinks these games need more adaptable intellect than his. Thus, he cannot attend the party. He also notes that the cheap ornament from the Xmas tree is not adequate compensation.
