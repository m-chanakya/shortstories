The Emperor sent a message to a man and this man alone on his deathbed. The man, the Emperor's pathetic subject, took refuge at the furthest distance. He ordered a messenger to kneel and whispered a message to him, asked him to repeat it back to confirm the accuracy. In front a crowd, who came to witness his death, he dispatched him. The messenger started off at once, and tried to make his away through, he moved forward easier than others, but the crowd was too huge. If it was an open field, he would have flown through. However it wasn't, and thus his efforts were futile. If he managed to get through the innermost palace, there would still be the steps, and the courtyards, the second palace, and then again more stairs and courtyards and another palace and so on for many years. Even if finally, he did cross the outermost door, he wouldn't be able to push his away through the city. While the man sits and dreams of the evening when the message comes.
