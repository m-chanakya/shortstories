This story is told by Benson Foley. He met Conway, who was from Franklin, Tennessee, while he was visiting. Conway brought a note of introduction from Barting. He had known Barting before. Barthing had settled in Franking and became a prominent lawyer, and seemed like an honorable, truthful man. The friendship in the note was enough for Foley to like Conway. One day, Conway told Foley that, Conway and Barting had an agreement that whichever of the two died first would try to communicate with the other from the beyond the grave in some way of their choice.
A few weeks after that, Foley met Conway, but Conway greeted him coldy, which left him surprised and piqued. The next day, He met him again, and seeing him about to greet him the same way, he asked for an explanation. Conway said that he didn't think he had any claim to Foley's friendship since Barting appears to not be friends with Conway anymore, and that Barting would let him know this. Foley replied saying he has not heard from Barting. Conway was surprised as he had seen him yesterday greeting him coldly, the same way he greeted Foley. Foley then explained to Conway that Barting died four days ago before this, and showed him letters annoucing it. Conway was visibly affected, and admitted that he was mistaken as he remembered the man that greeted him did not have Barting's mustache. The subject was never mentioned again. However, Conway had inclosed in the letter a picture of Barting a week before death without a mustache.
