The narrator ponders about why borrowing a match upon the street is not a simple thing. He says that any man that has tried will agree. One day, the narrator was standing on the street with a cigar. He had no match. He saw an ordinary-looking man and asked him for a match. The man agreed to give him once as he knew he had one. He looked all through his jacket but couldn't find one. He put his parcels down and checked again. He claimed maybe it was in another waistcoat. Despite the narrator's protests, he continued. He got pretty worked up and threw down his walking-stick, tearing his pockets with his teeth. He blamed his son and continued to check. He threw his letters, he tore out his pockets, trampled his parcels. Finally, he thought he found it and handed it to the narrator. It was a toothpick. The narrator pushed him under a trolley-car and ran.
