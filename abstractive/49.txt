In the old city of Rome, many years ago, there were two boys looking at their mother and her friend. The younger one thought the friend looked liked a queen. The elder said she has a fine dress, but it was their mother that looks like a queen. The younger one agreed. Cornelia, their mother came to speak to them. She was dressed plainly, with bare arms and feet as was the custom. She had no jewels or crown. She said her friend would show them her jewels after dinner. When dinner was over, the casket with the jewels was opened and the boys were dazzled. They said if only their mother could have jewels like this. The mother's friend then asked the mother if she was poor as she had no jewels. The mother disagreed. She drew her sons to her side and said they were her jewels and they were worth more than all hers. The boys never forgot their mother's pride. Years later they became great men and they often thought of this.
