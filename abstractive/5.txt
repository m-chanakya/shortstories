Two young newlyweds were walking on the platform of a country station. They were both happy. The moon envied their happiness. The wife exclaimed to her husband, Sasha about how beautiful it all was. Her husband replied to his wife, Varya saying she was just excited. He also found out from her that there was a small meal for two for supper that night. The moon was reminded of her loneliness by their happiness. 
The young couple happily decided to see the train come in and then go home. 
Two little girls ran out of the train and hung on Varya's neck. They were followed by a lady, a man, two schoolboys with laden bags, a governess and a grandmother. The gentleman said they were all there to visit for three or four days. At the sight of their uncle and his family, the young couple were horror-stricken. Sasha saw a vision. Their little cottage crowded, them giving up their rooms, the food for two, and noise and the confusion and their aunt talking continously for the next few days. Sasha looked angrily at his wife, blamed her for the visit. Nevertheless, Varya welcomed them.The moon saw this and was happy that she had no relations.
