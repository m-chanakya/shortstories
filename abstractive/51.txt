Dan Murphy enlisted as a private and fought bravely. All the boys liked him. When a wound weakened him so much that he could no longer carry a musket, they fixed him up as a sutler. He made money and sent it to his wife. She knew not to waste money. She began to get misery. She had known what it was to have nothing. Then, Dan died. They boys telegraphed her to know if she would like him to be sent home. Mrs. Murphy thought this would be cheap, and said yes. At the wake the bill arrived and she cried. It hurt everyone.She found out it was not cheap at all.
