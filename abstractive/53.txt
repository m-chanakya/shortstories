The gun shot was hear through the night. Not an unusal sound where Dr. Chevalier had his office. Scream usually went with it, but not this time. The doctor entered the house that he had been called to. He noted the same details that accompanied these events. However it was not the same. She was surely dead, but this face was familar to him. He had met her in a cabin years ago, where he had taken shelter during an expedition. He met her family. She had been a clever girl, too clever to stay in the cabin. She was going to go to the big city. The doctor declared her dead, and charged himself with burial. He sent a letter that lied to her family saying she died of a sickness, and invented her last words. People wondered why the doctor had cared for a woman of doubtful repute. It blew over.
