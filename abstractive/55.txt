There was once an animal that was born in a cage. There he grew under the invisible care of a hand. It gave him food, water, and a bed. The animal found it good. He thought the sun existed just to light his home. One day, he woke up and found the door of the cage left open by accident. He approached the door. He would have closed it, but his limps were numb. He thrust his head out to see the sky broader and the world wider. He went back to the corner of the cage, however he was too curious now, and he went back to the opening and then he was gone. He ran out, seeing, smelling, touching everything. Stopping only to drink. He has to fight for food. He is living, joying and suffering. The door of the cage is still open and it is still empty.
