Mark Spayley said he wanted to marry Duncan Dullamy's daughter, even though he was a poor artist. Duncan was secretly revlieved to find even such a husband for his daughter as he was almost broke due to his new venture, the breakfast food, Pipenta. Duncan asked Mark if he would still marry his daughter Leonore if she was poor and Mark said yes. Thus, Duncan agreed, and suggested an early wedding date. Mark told him he wanted to give back. Duncan asked him to get people to buy his breakfast food. Mark said it just needed new branding. Mark changed it's name to Filboid Studge and made posters depicting a hell where people could not buy the food. It did not explain how healthy it was, it just said that the famous looking people in the poster could not buy it now. It used the idea that people will do things from a sense of duty. This drove housewives to demand for it at stores, and made them enforce it more the more it was hated. A bishop preached against the poster, someone died from eating too much, and soliders mutinied and shot officers rather than eat it. It became a household name. Dullamy realized this would not last, and sold his interests. Leonore was a bigger heiress than before, and he found her a better husband than Mark. Mark cursed the day he made the poster.
