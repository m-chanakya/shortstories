There was a family of Five little Pigs, and Mrs. Pig was there mother. Some pigs were good, and tried to please their mother. The first little pig, Mr.Pig, went to the market. He was the eldest and most useful pig. He went to the market with a cart full of vegetables. Rusty, the donkey, refused to pull the cart, so Mr. Pig drew the cart himself. Once he got there, he sold his vegetables. Rusty came to the market, willing to pull the cart again. Mr. Pig started for home, reached, and told him mother the story. She called him her best son. The next little pig stayed at home. This pig wanted to be like his borther, but was too mischievous. His mother made him stay home, and watch the fire while she went out. He, instead of learning his lesson, did naughty things. When his mother came home, she saw the mischief and gave him a beating he would never forget. The next little pig had roast beef. The one after that had none. This pig was the most obstinate pig. His mother set him to learn his lesson, but he tore the book. He ran off the play with the other pigs. He fought with one, got beat up. He stayed out, afraid to come home, and caught a cold. He was taken home and put to bed with some medicine. The last little pig cried "wee, wee" all the way home. He had gone fishing and was told to not fish in Farmer Grumpey's territory. But he went fishing there anyway, he caught something, and tried to carry it home. The Farmer came with a whip, the pig dropped the fish and whip hit his back. The pig ran off home, crying.
