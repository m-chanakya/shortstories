Once, a ship was driven into a rock, and broken into two by the waves. Half of it was on a rock, and the surviving crew clinged onto it. They knew it would soon be washed away too. In a lighthouse nearby, there was Grace Darling, the daughter of the lighthouse keeper. She lived by the sea her entire life. In the darkness of the night, she heard screams and wild cries. When daylight came, she could see the men clinging to the masts. She told her father they must help them. Her father told her the waves would be too hard, but she was adamant. They set off. Grace pulling one oar, and her father the other. They rowed hard against the sea, the waves crashed into them. They would have been dashed if not for Grace. Her father climbed onto the wreck, while Grace held the boat, the crew were helped on board. It was all that Grace could do to keep the boat from being drifted away. Her father came back and they set off. They were all back safe in the lighthouse. Grace cared for all the men. She will never be forgotten. She is buried now not far from home, and many people go to see her grave. There is a monument, that speaks of the need, of a woman lying with a boat's oar held in her hand.
