The writer of this story found the following in a paper. He found the coincidence between his own experience and that of Mr. Benton remarkable. Thus, he must comment on the paper. The paper talks about Benton and his mother's influence. Benton says his mother asked him not to use tobacco which he never did from then. She asked him not to gamble, which he never did, and she asked him not to drink liquor. He attributes his usefulness through life to having complied with her wishes. He didn't drink since she asked him at seven not to. He owes his adherence to this to his mother. The writer says he shares the same moral career, with a grandmother instead of a mother. His grandmother told him not to use tobacco before breakfast, and he never did that that hour. She asked him not to gamble with bad cards, and he never did. She asked him not to drink when he was two. He did not, and enjoyed the effects. He owes it to his grandmother. He never drunk any kind of water from that day.
