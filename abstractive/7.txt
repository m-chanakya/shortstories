There was once an artist that painted a beautiful picture and place it so he could see it in the mirror. The animals in the woods heard about this picture through the housecat who could tell them what they did not know before. They asked what a picture was. The housecat told them it it's a beautiful flat thing.  They then asked the cat what a mirror was, to which he replied that it was a hole in the wall which when you look into it you see the picture. 
The ass doubted this, and he made his doubts known. These doubts effected the animals. The cat got offended and left. The subject was dropped for a couple of day, till curiosity took a fresh start. The animals were angry at the ass for spoiling this without evidence. The ass said he would go check and tell them what he finds. He did not know where to stand in front of the mirror and ended up blocking the painting with his ears. He returned saying the cat was a liar and that he saw nothing in the mirror except an another ass. Many other witnesses tried and all they saw was another animal that looked like them. They could not understand the truth. Finally, the Hathi, angrily, went to look for himself, saw an elephant, returned and called everyone a liar. The moral of the story by the cat is that you can find whatever you bring if you stand between it and your imagination. You may not see your ears, but they will be there.
