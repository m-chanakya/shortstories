Once there was an uninhabited island on which there lived a Parsee. He had nothing except this hat, his knife and his stove. One day he baked a cake. He was about it eat it when he saw a Rhinoceros with few manners coming down to the beach. In those days, the Rhinoceros's skin fitted quite tight, and there were no wrinkles. The Parsee left the cake, and climbed a tree. The Rhinoceros upset the stove and the cake rolled on the sand. He then ate it and left. The Parsee came down and the Rhinoceros would pay. Weeks later, due to a heat wave, everyone including the Rhinoceros took off their clothes. The Rhinoceros took off his skin and carried it to the beach. In those days, it buttoned underneath. He went into the water leaving his skin on the shore. The Parsee found the skin, went back to his camp, filled his hat with cake crumbs, and came back to shake, scrub and rub the skin full of tickly cake crumbs. He waited for the Rhinoceros to put his skin back on. The cake crumbs tickled him. Scratching and rolling made it worse. He rubbed himself against a palm tree. He rubbed his skin into many folds, and he rubbed the buttons off, he rubbed more folds on his legs. This spoiled his temper. As it made no difference. He went home scrathy. From that day, every rhinoceros has folds in their skin and a bad temper.
