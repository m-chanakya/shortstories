One time the Danes drove King Alfred away from his kingdom. He laid hidden for a long time on an island. One day all except him, his queen and a servant went fishing. A beggar came to the King's door and asked for some food. The King had very little food, but he gave the beggar half of all he had. The beggar thanked him. The people who went fishing came back and told the king that they had caught more fish than ever before. The king was glad and the people hopeful. The king laid awake that night and thought about the events of the day. He, then, saw a light like the sun and a man with black hair holding a book. It seemed very real. The man told him that he made all the events of that day happen that the he should go to war with the Danes the next morning, and if he did the Danes would be beaten. So the next morning, the King told his soliders what had happened, and led them to battle. He won and ruled for the rest of his days.
