In England there was a King named Alfred. Then, there was war all the time with the Danes fighting the English. After a great battle, it was every man for himself. Alfred had fled alone. He found the hut of a woodcutter. He was very tired and hungry. He begged the woodcutter's wife for some food. She pitied him, and didn't know he was a king. She said she would give him food if he watched the cakes to make sure they don't burn while she was gone. Alfred agreed. He got lost in thoughts about how to defeat the Danes. He forgot about the cakes. The woman came back and she was angry as they were burned. She hit the King with a stick. The King must have laughed at himself. Some days later the men gathered and beat the Danes in battle.
