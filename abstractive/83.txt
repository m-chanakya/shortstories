There was a king of England named Canut√©. The men and officers around him constantly praised him, saying he was the greatest and saying nothing dare disobey him. He grew tired of these foolish sppeches. One day he took his officers to the seashore. He thought he would teach them a lesson. He sat close to the edge of the water. He asked them if the water would obey him. The officers were confused but did not say no. One asked him to command it and it would obey. He asked the sea to come no father, but it did not listen. The officers were alarmed. The king threw his crown and said he would never wear it again. He said there was only one King that was all-powerful, he rules all, and it is he who they should praise and serve.
