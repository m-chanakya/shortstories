Old Mother Goose lived with her son, Jack. Jack was good-tempered, and industrious lad. There was a Gander who swam in their pond. They were a happy family. Mother Goose thought her Gander looked sad and lonely, so she sent Jack to the market to buy the finest Goose he could find. He started through a wood, and got lost, he heard a scream and ran towards it. He saw it came from a young lady running away from a thief. Jack sent the thief away, and returned to the lady. She thanked Jack. She was the daughter of the Squire and helped Jack out of the wood. She invited Jack to her father's house to thank him. Jack went to the market alone and there was only one Goose left. It was a good one. He took it home, and Mother Goose and Gander were very happy. However, Jack kept dreaming of the young lady. One day, he saw that the Goose had laid a golden egg. Mother Goose told him to sell it and use the money to visit the Squire. He did so, but was ripped off, and only got half the money it was worth. He wore his finest clothes and went to the Squire's house. The footmen laughed at Jack when he asked to see the Squire, so he bribed them. They, then, took him to the Squire. The Squire was a proud and rich man. Jack showed him the gold, and asked for this daughter's hand. The Squire was angry, and order that Jack be punished, but Jack was strong and it wasn't easy. The young lady came out and told her father to release him. Jack fell more in love. Then, the Goose laid a golden egg every morning, and Jack sold it for the right price. Soon he was richer than the Squire, and the Squire accepted him as his son-in-law.
