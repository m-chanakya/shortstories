North of Ireland is peculiarly religious, Half of are Protestants and the other Catholics. Each party tries to draw the affections of the irreligious. When the Catholics dedicated a new Cathedral and started home the Protestants lined the streets and threw stones at them. The region is marked with blood. Every man is a missionary and tries to admonish the erring.
Laws were made to break this up. Indulging in "party cries" shall be fined forty shillings and costs. In everyday reports, these cases are seen. The usual cry is "To hell with the Pope!" or "To hell with the Protestants!". One local joke keeps in mind that the fine is uniform regardless of economical status. The joke starts with a policeman finding a drunk man shouting "To hell with". The officer asks to hell with whom. The man asks the officer to finish the sentence himself as it would be too expensive for him to do so.
