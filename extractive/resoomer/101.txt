There was once a very brave man whose name was John Smith. He came to this country many years ago, when there were great woods everywhere, and many wild beasts and Indians. Many tales are told of his adventures, some of them true and some of them untrue. The most famous of all these is the following:--One day when Smith was in the woods, some Indians came upon him, and made him their prisoner. The king and all his great men stood around to see. The Indians raised their clubs. In another moment they would fall on Smith's head.
But just then a little Indian girl rushed in. She laid her own head upon his.
«O father!» she cried, «spare this man's life. I am sure he has done you no harm, and we ought to be his friends».
The men with the clubs could not strike, for they did not want to hurt the child. The king at first did not know what to do.
