ONE fine evening, a no less fine government clerk called Ivan Dmitritch Tchervyakov was sitting in the second row of the stalls, gazing through an opera glass at the Cloches de Corneville. He gazed and felt at the acme of bliss. But suddenly. . . . In stories one so often meets with this «But suddenly.» The authors are right: life is so full of surprises! But suddenly his face puckered up, his eyes disappeared, his breathing was arrested . . . he took the opera glass from his eyes, bent over and . . . «Aptchee!!» he sneezed as you perceive. It is not reprehensible for anyone to sneeze anywhere.

Tchervyakov was embarrassed, he smiled stupidly and fell to gazing at the stage. He gazed at it but was no longer feeling bliss. He began to be troubled by uneasiness. In the interval, he went up to Brizzhalov, walked beside him, and overcoming his shyness, muttered:
«I spattered you, your Excellency, forgive me . . . you see . . . I didn't do it to . . . ».
«Oh, that's enough . . . I'd forgotten it, and you keep on about it!» said the general, moving his lower lip impatiently.
«He has forgotten, but there is a fiendish light in his eye,» thought Tchervyakov, looking suspiciously at the general. «And he doesn't want to talk. I ought to explain to him . . . that I really didn't intend . . . that it is the law of nature or else he will think I meant to spit on him. He doesn't think so now, but he will think so later!»
