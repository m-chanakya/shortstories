There was an outcry at the door of the king's great hall, and suddenly a confusion arose. The guards ran thither swiftly, and the people were crowded together, pushing and thrusting as if to withhold some intruder. 

[...]

So the confusion fell apart, and the hall was very still, and a man in battered armour stumbled through the silence and stood in front of the throne. He was breathing hard, for he was weary and angry and afraid, and the sobbing of his breath shook him from head to foot. But his anger was stronger than his weariness and his fear, so he lifted his eyes hardily and looked the king in the face.
It was like the face of a mountain, very calm and very high, but not unkind. 
For answer the man drew from his breast a golden chain, at the end of which was a jewel set with a great blue stone. He looked at it for a moment with scorn, as one who had a grievance. Then he threw it down on the steps of the throne, and turned on his heel to go.
«Stay,» said the king. 
«I thought it to be yours,» said the man.
«Where did you get it?» asked the king.
«From an old servant of yours,» answered the man. «He gave it to me when I was but a lad, and told me it came from the king--it was the blue stone of the Truth, perfect and priceless. Therefore I must keep it as the apple of mine eye, and bring it back to the king perfect and unbroken».
«And you have done this?» said the king.
«Yes and no,» answered the man.
«Divide your answer,» said the king. «First, the yes».
The man delayed a moment before he spoke. 

«Will you give me my jewel?»

The man lifted his eyes in wonder. 

[...]

«I spoke not of that,» said the king, «but of your life, yourself».


[...]

«I had not thought of that,» said the man, «only of the jewel, not of myself, my life».
«Think of it now,» said the king, «and think clearly. 
«Is this true?» said the man, trembling and sinking on his knee.
«It is true,» answered the king, «as God lives, it is true.
