«MOTHER dear,» said a little mouse one day, «I think the people in our house must be very kind; don't you? They leave such nice things for us in the larder».
There was a twinkle in the mother's eye as she replied,—«Well, my child, no doubt they are very well in their way, but I don't think they are quite as fond of us as you seem to think. Now remember, Greywhiskers, I have absolutely forbidden you to put your nose above the ground unless I am with you, for kind as the people are, I shouldn't be at all surprised if they tried to catch you».
But he did feel a little guilty when he heard his mother calling. Off he ran, and was back in the nest again by the time his mother had finished rubbing her eyes after her nap.
She took Greywhiskers up to the pantry then, and when she saw the hole in the cake she seemed a little annoyed.
When the morning came, the cook, who had set the trap, lifted it from the shelf, and then called a pretty little girl to come and see the thief who had eaten her cake.
«What are you going to do with him?» asked Ethel.
«Why, drown him, my dear, to be sure».
The tears came into the little girl's pretty blue eyes.
