They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.
But one day their mother--Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.
First she scrubbed their faces .
Then she brushed their fur .
Then she combed their tails and whiskers .
Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.
Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.


When they stood up there were several green smears!

«Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall,» said Moppet.
They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.
Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.

They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised. Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.
Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.

Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.
She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.
«My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,» said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.


[...]

As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.
The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.
