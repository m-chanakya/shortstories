Here is another story of the battlefield, and it is much like the one which I have just told you.
Not quite a hundred years after the time of Sir Philip Sidney there was a war between the Swedes and the Danes. The Dane went to him at once. He knelt down by the side of his fallen foe, and pressed the flask to his lips.
«Drink,» said he, «for thy need is greater than mine».
Now I will punish you. I would have given you all the water, but now you shall have only half.» And with that he drank the half of it, and then gave the rest to the Swede.
