There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs of the village were so wide awake and watchful. He was really nothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to think of it.
One night this Wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. The Wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it. So the Wolf spoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fine appearance.
«You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to,» replied the Dog. 

«What is that on your neck?»

«Nothing at all,» replied the Dog. 

[...]

«But please tell me».
«Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened».
«What! A chain!» cried the Wolf. 
«Not always! But what's the difference?» replied the Dog.
