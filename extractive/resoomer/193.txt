There is a town in England called Gotham, and many merry stories are told of the queer people who used to live there.
One day two men of Gotham met on a bridge. Hodge was coming from the market, and Peter was going to the market.
«Where are you going?» said Hodge.
«I am going to the market to buy sheep,» said Peter.
«Buy sheep?» said Hodge. 
«I shall bring them over this bridge,» said Peter.
«No, you shall not,» said Hodge.
«Yes, but I will,» said Peter.
«You shall not,» said Hodge.
«I will,» said Peter.
Then they beat with their sticks on the ground as though there had been a hundred sheep between them.
«Take care!» cried Peter. «Look out that my sheep don't jump on the bridge».
«I care not where they jump,» said Hodge; «but they shall not go over it».
