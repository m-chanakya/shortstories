This is a story told by the late Benson Foley of San Francisco

In the summer of 1881 I met a man named James H. Conway, a resident of Franklin, Tennessee. I had known Barting as a captain in the Federal army during the civil war. Barting had always seemed to me an honorable and truthful man, and the warm friendship which he expressed in his note for Mr. Conway was to me sufficient evidence that the latter was in every way worthy of my confidence and esteem. If he has not already informed you he probably will do so. 

'But,' I replied, 'I have not heard from Mr. Barting. 'Heard from him!' he repeated, with apparent surprise. I met him yesterday ten minutes before meeting you. I gave you exactly the same greeting that he gave me. 

All this seemed to me singularly considerate and delicate behavior on the part of Mr. Conway. As dramatic situations and literary effects are foreign to my purpose I will explain at once that Mr. Barting was dead. He had died in Nashville four days before this conversation. He was visibly affected in a way that forbade me to entertain a doubt of his sincerity. 

'It seems incredible,' he said, after a period of reflection. 'I suppose I must have mistaken another man for Barting, and that man's cold greeting was merely a stranger's civil acknowledgment of my own. I remember, indeed, that he lacked Barting's mustache.
