It was a dark September morning. There was a storm at sea. A ship had been driven on a low rock off the shores of the Farne Islands. It had been broken in two by the waves, and half of it had been washed away. 

[...]

On one of the islands was a lighthouse; and there, all through that stormy night, Grace Darling had listened to the storm.
Grace was the daughter of the lighthouse keeper, and she had lived by the sea as long as she could remember.
In the darkness of the night, above the noise of the winds and waves, she heard screams and wild cries. When daylight came, she could see the wreck, a mile away, with the angry waters all around it. She could see the men clinging to the masts.
«We must try to save them!» she cried. 
«It is of no use, Grace,» said her father. «We cannot reach them».
He was an old man, and he knew the force of the mighty waves.
«We cannot stay here and see them die,» said Grace. «We must at least try to save them».
Her father could not say, «No».
In a few minutes they were ready. They set off in the heavy lighthouse boat. Grace pulled one oar, and her father the other, and they made straight toward the wreck. But it was hard rowing against such a sea, and it seemed as though they would never reach the place.
At last they were close to the rock, and now they were in greater danger than before. The fierce waves broke against the boat, and it would have been dashed in pieces, had it not been for the strength and skill of the brave girl.
