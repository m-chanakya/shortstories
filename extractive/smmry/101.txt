There was once a very brave man whose name was John Smith.

He came to this country many years ago, when there were great woods everywhere, and many wild beasts and Indians.

The most famous of all these is the following:- One day when Smith was in the woods, some Indians came upon him, and made him their prisoner.

A large stone was brought in, and Smith was made to lie down with his head on it.

Then two tall Indians with big clubs in their hands came forward.

In another moment they would fall on Smith's head. But just then a little Indian girl rushed in.

She ran and threw herself between Smith and the up-lift-ed clubs.

Then he spoke to some of his warriors, and they lifted Smith from the ground.

The next day the king sent Smith home; and several Indians went with him to protect him from harm.
