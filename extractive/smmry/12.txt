Palace of Saint Nicholas in the Moon Christmas Morning My Dear Susy Clemens, I have received and read all the letters which you and your little sister have written me.

You must tell George he must walk on tiptoe and not speak- otherwise he will die someday.

Then you must go up to the nursery and stand on a chair or the nurse's bed and put your ear to the speaking tube that leads down to the kitchen and when I whistle through it you must speak in the tube and say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!" Then I will ask whether it was a trunk you ordered or not.

If you say it was, I shall ask you what color you want the trunk to be and then you must tell me every single thing in detail which you want the trunk to contain.

I will go to the moon and get those things and in a few minutes I will come down the chimney that belongs to the fireplace that is in the hall-if it is a trunk you want-because I couldn't get such a thing as a trunk down the nursery chimney, you know.

George must not use a broom, but a rag-else he will die someday.

If my boot should leave a stain on the marble, George must not holystone it away.
