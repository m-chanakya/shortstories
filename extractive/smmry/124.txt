A very young Mouse, who had never seen anything of the world, almost came to grief the very first time he ventured out. One of them had a very kind and gracious look, but the other was the most fearful monster you can imagine. It was nobody but the Barnyard Cock and the first one the little Mouse had ever seen.

"If it had not been for that terrible monster," the Mouse went on, "I should have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature, who looked so good and gentle. He had thick, velvety fur, a meek face, and a look that was very modest, though his eyes were bright and shining. As he looked at me he waved his fine long tail and smiled. So be thankful, my child, that you escaped with your life, and, as long as you live, never judge people by their looks."
