ONE fine evening, a no less fine government clerk called Ivan Dmitritch Tchervyakov was sitting in the second row of the stalls, gazing through an opera glass at the Cloches de Corneville.

In the old gentleman, Tchervyakov recognised Brizzhalov, a civilian general serving in the Department of Transport.

"I have spattered him," thought Tchervyakov, "He is not the head of my department, but still it is awkward. I must apologise." Tchervyakov gave a cough, bent his whole person forward, and whispered in the general's ear.

"Pardon, your Excellency, I spattered you accidentally...." "Never mind, never mind." "For goodness sake excuse me, I ... I did not mean to." "Oh, please, sit down! let me listen!" Tchervyakov was embarrassed, he smiled stupidly and fell to gazing at the stage.

"Still, you had better go and apologise," she said, "Or he will think you don't know how to behave in public." "That's just it! I did apologise, but he took it somehow queerly ... he didn't say a word of sense. There wasn't time to talk properly." Next day Tchervyakov put on a new uniform, had his hair cut and went to Brizzhalov's to explain; going into the general's reception room he saw there a number of petitioners and among them the general himself, who was beginning to interview them.

After questioning several petitioners the general raised his eyes and looked at Tchervyakov.

"Where's the making fun in it?" thought Tchervyakov, "There is nothing of the sort! He is a general, but he can't understand. If that is how it is I am not going to apologise to that fanfaron any more! The devil take him. I'll write a letter to him, but I won't go. By Jove, I won't." So thought Tchervyakov as he walked home; he did not write a letter to the general, he pondered and pondered and could not make up that letter.

"What?" asked Tchervyakov, in a whisper turning numb with horror.

Something seemed to give way in Tchervyakov's stomach.
