A married Couple possessed two Boys named Joseph and Clarence. They would not permit him to play with other Boys for fear that he would soil himself;

Little Joseph was kept away from the Public Schools, and had to Play Games in the Garret with two Spindly Little Girls. When he was Ten Years of age he could play Chop-Sticks on the Piano; The Boys held him under the Pump the first Night. When he walked across the Campus, they would whistle, "I don't Want to Play in Your Yard." One Day he ran away with a Girl who waited on the Table at his Boarding House, and his Parents Cast him Off.

Seeing that the Home Training Experiment had been a Failure in the case of Joseph, the Parents decided to give Clarence a large Measure of Liberty, that he might become Acquainted with the Snares and Temptations of the World while he was Young, and thus be Prepared to side-step the Pitfalls when he was Older.

Clarence stood in with the Toughest Push in Town, and thus became acquainted with the Snares and Temptations of the World.

When his Father suggested that he enter some Business House, and become a Credit to the Family, he growled like a Boston Terrier, and told his Father to go Chase Himself.
