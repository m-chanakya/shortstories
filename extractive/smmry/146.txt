In every country, men told about his daring deeds; and they said that since Alexander the Great there had been no king like him.

On the king's wrist sat his favorite hawk; for in those days hawks were trained to hunt.

All day long Genghis Khan and his huntsmen rode through the woods.

The king had often ridden through the woods, and he knew all the paths.

The day had been warm, and the king was very thirsty.

At last, to his joy, he saw some water trickling down over the edge of a rock.

In the wet season, a swift stream of water always poured down here; but now it came only one drop at a time.

It took a long time to fill the cup; and the king was so thirsty that he could hardly wait.

All at once there was a whirring sound in the air, and the cup was knocked from his hands.

The hawk flew back and forth a few times, and then alighted among the rocks by the spring.

The king picked up the cup, and again held it to catch the trickling drops.

When the cup was half full, he lifted it toward his mouth.

Before it had touched his lips, the hawk swooped down again, and knocked it from his hands.

He tried again; and for the third time the hawk kept him from drinking.

"If I had you in my hands, I would wring your neck!" Then he filled the cup again.

"Now, Sir Hawk," he said, "This is the last time." He had hardly spoken, before the hawk swooped down and knocked the cup from his hand.

The next moment the poor hawk lay bleeding and dying at its master's feet.

"The hawk saved my life!" he cried; "And how did I repay him? He was my best friend, and I have killed him." He clambered down the bank.
