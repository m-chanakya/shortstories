Out of the tumult came a strong voice shouting, "I will come in! I must see the false king!" But other voices cried, "Not so-you are mad-you shall not come in thus!" Then the king said, "Let him come in as he will!" So the confusion fell apart, and the hall was very still, and a man in battered armour stumbled through the silence and stood in front of the throne.

When the man saw it clearly he knew that he was looking at the true king; but his anger was not quenched, and he stood stiff, with drawn brows, until the king said, "Speak!" For answer the man drew from his breast a golden chain, at the end of which was a jewel set with a great blue stone.

"The no also is right, O king! But not by my fault. The jewel is not untarnished, not perfect. It never was. There is a flaw in the stone. I saw it first when I entered the light of your palace-gate. Look, it is marred and imperfect, a thing of little value. It is not the crystal of Truth. I have been deceived. You have claimed my life for a fool's errand, a thing of naught; no jewel, but a bauble. Take it. It is yours." The king looked not at the gold chain and the blue stone, but at the face of the man.

"It is there," he cried, "At your feet!" "I spoke not of that," said the king, "But of your life, yourself." "My life," said the man faltering, "What is that? Is it not ended?" "It is begun," said the king.

"Your life-yourself, what of that?" "I had not thought of that," said the man, "Only of the jewel, not of myself, my life." "Think of it now," said the king, "And think clearly. Have you not learned courage and hardiness? Have not your labours brought you strength; your perils, wisdom; your wounds, patience? Has not your task broken chains for you, and lifted you out of sloth and above fear? Do you say that the stone that has done this for you is false, a thing of naught?" "Is this true?" said the man, trembling and sinking on his knee.
