Across the top of the cake there were words written in pink sugar; but as Greywhiskers could not read, he did not know that he was nibbling at little Miss Ethel's birthday cake.

She took Greywhiskers up to the pantry then, and when she saw the hole in the cake she seemed a little annoyed.

"Some mouse has evidently been here before us," she said, but of course she never guessed that it was her own little son.

In ran Greywhiskers oh! "Click" went the little wooden house, and mousie was caught fast in a trap.

When the morning came, the cook, who had set the trap, lifted it from the shelf, and then called a pretty little girl to come and see the thief who had eaten her cake.

"Why, drown him, my dear, to be sure." The tears came into the little girl's pretty blue eyes.

"No," squeaked Greywhiskers sadly; "Indeed I didn't." Cook's back was turned for a moment, and in that moment tender-hearted little Ethel lifted the lid of the trap, and out popped mousie.
