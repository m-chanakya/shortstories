There was once a king whose name was Dionysius.

But he was very rich, and he lived in a fine palace where there were many beautiful and costly things, and he was waited upon by a host of servants who were always ready to do his bidding. One day a friend of his, whose name was Damocles, said to him,--

"How happy you must be! said Damocles; "but I think, that, if I could only have your riches and your pleasures for one day, I should not want any greater happiness."

And so, the next day, Damocles was led into the palace, and all the servants were bidden to treat him as their master. He sat down at a table in the banquet hall, and rich foods were placed before him. It was a sharp sword, and it was hung by only a single horse-hair.

The smile faded from the lips of Damocles. cried Damocles.

"Yes," said Dionysius, "I know there is a sword above your head, and that it may fall at any moment. I have a sword over my head all the time. I am every moment in dread lest something may cause me to lose my life." "I now see that I was mistaken, and that the rich and powerful are not so happy as they seem.

And so long as he lived, he never again wanted to be rich, or to change places, even for a moment, with the king.
