One day their mother-Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit-expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.

Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.

Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off.

"Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ashpit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pigsty and the Puddle-ducks." Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.

They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road. Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.

While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat! They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens.

Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.

"Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!" Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles.

He and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step-pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat! Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.
