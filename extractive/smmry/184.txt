A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country.

For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink.

The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite.

After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened.

In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her.

There were sweetmeats and jellies, pastries, delicious cheeses the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine.

Just as the Country Mouse was about to nibble a dainty bit of pastry, she heard a Cat mew loudly and scratch at the door.

The Country Mouse stopped in the Town Mouse's den only long enough to pick up her carpet bag and umbrella.
