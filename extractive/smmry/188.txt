 Not quite a hundred years after the time of Sir Philip Sidney there was a war between the Swedes and the Danes.

One day a great battle was fought, and the Swedes were beaten, and driven from the field.

A soldier of the Danes who had been slightly wounded was sitting on the ground.

All at once he heard some one say,- "O sir! give me a drink, for I am dying." It was a wounded Swede who spoke.

"Drink," said he, "For thy need is greater than mine." Hardly had he spoken these words, when the Swede raised himself on his elbow.

"Why did you spare the life of the Swede after he had tried to kill you?" asked the king.
