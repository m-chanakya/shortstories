The young man was noble and brave, and everybody hoped that he would some day be the King of England.

One summer Prince William went with his father across the sea to look after their lands in France.

They were welcomed with joy by all their people there, and the young prince was so gallant and kind, that he won the love of all who saw him.

The king, with his wise men and brave knights, set sail early in the day; but Prince William with his younger friends waited a little while.

Then they went on board of the ship which was waiting to carry them home.

On the ship, everything had been arranged to make the trip a pleasant one.

So the prince, and the young people who were with him, gave themselves up to merriment and feasting and joy.

A small boat was quickly launched, and the prince with a few of his bravest friends leaped into it.

They pushed off just as the ship was beginning to settle beneath the waves.

Would they be saved? They had rowed hardly ten yards from the ship, when there was a cry from among those that were left behind.

The prince stood up, and held out his arms for his sister.

Ship and boat, prince and princess, and all the gay company that had set sail from France, went down to the bottom together.
