There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs of the village were so wide awake and watchful.

The Wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it.

So the Wolf spoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fine appearance.

"You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to," replied the Dog.

"Hardly anything," answered the House Dog.

"What! nothing!" "Oh, just a trifle!" "But please tell me." "Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened." "What! A chain!" cried the Wolf.

"Don't you go wherever you please?" "Not always! But what's the difference?" replied the Dog.
