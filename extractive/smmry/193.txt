Hodge was coming from the market, and Peter was going to the market.

"I am going to the market to buy sheep," said Peter.

"And which way will you bring them home?" "I shall bring them over this bridge," said Peter.

"Have a care," said Hodge; "For if you say too much, I will put my fingers in your mouth." "Will you?" said Peter.

Just then another man of Gotham came from the market with a sack of meal on his horse.

"It is strange that you will never learn wisdom.-Come here, Peter, and help me lay my sack on my shoul-der." Peter did so, and the man carried his meal to the side of the bridge.

"Now, neighbors," he said, "Can you tell how much meal is in my sack?" "There is none at all!" cried Hodge and Peter together.

Said the man; "And you that stand here and quarrel about nothing, have no more sense in your heads than I have meal in my sack!".
