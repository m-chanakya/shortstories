He ordered the herald to kneel down beside his death bed and whispered the message to him.

Sticking one arm out and then another, he makes his way through the crowd.

Instead of that, how futile are all his efforts.

He is still forcing his way through the private rooms of the innermost palace.

He would have to stride through the courtyards, and after the courtyards the second palace encircling the first, and, then again, stairs and courtyards, and then, once again, a palace, and so on for thousands of years.

If he finally did burst through the outermost door-but that can never, never happen-the royal capital city, the centre of the world, is still there in front of him, piled high and full of sediment.

No one pushes his way through here, certainly not with a message from a dead man.

You sit at your window and dream to yourself of that message when evening comes.
