A lion had come into the cave, and was roaring loudly.

Soon he saw that the lion was not angry, but that he limped as though his foot hurt him.

Then Androclus grew so bold that he took hold of the lion's lame paw to see what was the matter.

The lion stood quite still, and rubbed his head against the man's shoulder.

He seemed to say,- "I know that you will help me." Androclus lifted the paw from the ground, and saw that it was a long, sharp thorn which hurt the lion so much.

Roclus was not at all afraid after this; and when night came, he and the lion lay down and slept side by side.

For a long time, the lion brought food to Androclus every day; and the two became such good friends, that Androclus found his new life a very happy one.

So a fierce lion was shut up for a while without food, and a time was set for the fight.

The people, who had expected to see the man killed by the lion, were filled with wonder.

They saw Androclus put his arms around the lion's neck; they saw the lion lie down at his feet, and lick them lovingly; they saw the great beast rub his head against the slave's face as though he wanted to be petted.

So he stood up before them, and, with his arm around the lion's neck, told how he and the beast had lived together in the cave.

"I am a man," he said; "But no man has ever befriended me. This poor lion alone has been kind to me; and we love each other as brothers." The people were not so bad that they could be cruel to the poor slave now.

"Live and be free!" Others cried, "Let the lion go free too! Give both of them their liberty!" And so Androclus was set free, and the lion was given to him for his own.
