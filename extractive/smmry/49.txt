They were looking at their mother and her friend, who were walking among the flowers and trees.

"Did you ever see so handsome a lady as our mother's friend?" asked the younger boy, holding his tall brother's hand.

"She looks like a queen." "Yet she is not so beautiful as our mother," said the elder boy.

"There is no woman in Rome so much like a queen as our own dear mother." Soon Cornelia, their mother, came down the walk to speak with them.

"Boys," she said, "I have something to tell you." They bowed before her, as Roman lads were taught to do, and said, "What is it, mother?" "You are to dine with us today, here in the garden; and then our friend is going to show us that wonderful casket of jewels of which you have heard so much." The brothers looked shyly at their mother's friend.

"Ah!" whispered the younger; "If our mother could only have such beautiful things!" At last the casket was closed and carried carefully away.
