with a dead girl stretched somewhere, as this one was. Certainly she was dead: there was the hole in the temple where she had sent the bullet through. Other such faces had been unfamiliar to him, except so far as they bore the common stamp of death. The place, a homely cabin down in Arkansas, in which he and a friend had found shelter and hospitality during a hunting expedition. a father and mother--coarse, and bent with toil, but proud as archangels of their handsome girl, who was too clever to stay in an Arkansas cabin, and who was going away to seek her fortune in the big city.

"The girl is dead," said Doctor Chevalier. One, doubtless, to carry sorrow, but no shame to the cabin down there in the forest.

It told that the girl had sickened and died.

Of course it was noised about that Doctor Chevalier had cared for the remains of a woman of doubtful repute.
