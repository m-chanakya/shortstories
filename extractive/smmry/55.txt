There was once an animal born into this world, and opening his eyes upon Life, he saw above and about him confining walls, and before him were bars of iron through which came air and light from without; this animal was born in a cage.

Here he grew, and throve in strength and beauty under the care of an invisible protecting hand.

Awaking one day from his slothful rest, lo! the door of his cage stood open: accident had opened it.

So out the opening he thrust his head, to see the canopy of the sky grow broader, and the world waxing wider.

Back to his corner but not to rest, for the spell of the Unknown was over him, and again and again he goes to the open door, seeing each time more Light.

So does he live, seeking, finding, joying and suffering.

The door which accident had opened is opened still, but the cage remains forever empty!
