There was once a family of Five Little Pigs, and Mrs. Pig, their mother, loved them all very dearly.

Some of these little pigs were very good, and took a great deal of trouble to please her.

The eldest pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr. Pig.

So Mr. Pig took him out of the shafts, and being very strong, drew the cart to market himself.

They did not laugh so loudly when Mr. Pig told them all his struggles on the road. Mr. Pig lost no time in selling his vegetables, and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the market-place, and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the cart, Mr. Pig started for home without delay.

When he got there, he told Mrs. Pig his story, and she called him her best and most worthy son.

This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother, but as he was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away, his mother made him stay at home, and told him to keep a good fire while she went out to the miller's to buy some flour.

When Mrs. Pig came home, she sat down by the fire, and being very tired, she soon fell asleep.

No sooner had she done so, than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and tied her in her chair.

So she quickly brought out her thickest and heaviest birch, and gave this naughty little pig such a beating as he did not forget for a long time.

When his mother came back he ran off into the streets to play with other idle little pigs like himself.

In spite of what he had been told, this foolish little pig went there.

He quickly dropped the fish, but the farmer caught him, and as he laid his whip over his back for some time, the little pig ran off, crying, "Wee, wee, wee," all the way home.
