The waves were dashing over it, and in a little while it too would be carried to the bottom.

Could any one save the poor, half-drowned men who were there? On one of the islands was a lighthouse; and there, all through that stormy night, Grace Darling had listened to the storm.

Grace was the daughter of the lighthouse keeper, and she had lived by the sea as long as she could remember.

In the darkness of the night, above the noise of the winds and waves, she heard screams and wild cries.

"Let us go out in the boat at once!" "It is of no use, Grace," said her father.

"We cannot reach them." He was an old man, and he knew the force of the mighty waves.

"We cannot stay here and see them die," said Grace.

Grace pulled one oar, and her father the other, and they made straight toward the wreck.

The fierce waves broke against the boat, and it would have been dashed in pieces, had it not been for the strength and skill of the brave girl.

After many trials, Grace's father climbed upon the wreck, while Grace herself held the boat.

There Grace proved to be no less tender as a nurse than she had been brave as a sailor.

All this happened a long time ago, but the name of Grace Darling will never be forgotten.

It is not a large monument, but it is one that speaks of the noble deed which made Grace Darling famous.
