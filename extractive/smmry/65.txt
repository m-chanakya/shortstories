The Sandwich Island paper says: How touching is this tribute of the late Hon.

T. H. Benton to his mother's influence:-'My mother asked me never to use tobacco; I have never touched it from that time to the present day.

She asked me not to gamble, and I have never gambled.

How well I remember my grandmother's asking me not to use tobacco, good old soul! She said, "You're at it again, are you, you whelp? Now don't ever let me catch you chewing tobacco before breakfast again, or I lay I'll blacksnake you within an inch of your life!" I have never touched it at that hour of the morning from that time to the present day.

She whispered and said, "Put up those wicked cards this minute!-two pair and a jack, you numskull, and the other fellow's got a flush!" I never have gambled from that day to this-never once-without a "Cold deck" in my pocket.

I have never drunk a drop from that day to this of any kind of water.
