Once upon a time an artist who had painted a small and very beautiful picture placed it so that he could see it in the mirror.

They asked what a picture was, and the cat explained.

Then the bear asked: "What is it that makes it so beautiful?" "It is the looks of it," said the cat.

Then the cow asked: "What is a mirror?" "It is a hole in the wall," said the cat.

"You look in it, and there you see the picture, and it is so dainty and charming and ethereal and inspiring in its unimaginable beauty that your head turns round and round, and you almost swoon with ecstasy." The ass had not said anything as yet; he now began to throw doubts.

Then the animals assailed the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them, on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful, without any evidence that such was the case.

The ass was not, troubled; he was calm, and said there was one way to find out who was in the right, himself or the cat: he would go and look in that hole, and come back and tell what he found there.

He returned home and said: "The cat lied. There was nothing in that hole but an ass. There wasn't a sign of a flat thing visible. It was a handsome ass, and friendly, but just an ass, and nothing more." The elephant asked: "Did you see it good and clear? Were you close to it?" "I saw it good and clear, O Hathi, King of Beasts. I was so close that I touched noses with it." "This is very strange," said the elephant; "The cat was always truthful before-as far as we could make out. Let another witness try. Go, Baloo, look in the hole, and come and report." So the bear went.

When he came back, he said: "Both the cat and the ass have lied; there was nothing in the hole but a bear." Great was the surprise and puzzlement of the animals.
