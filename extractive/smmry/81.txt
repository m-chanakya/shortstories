At one time the Danes drove King Alfred from his kingdom, and he had to lie hidden for a long time on a little island in a river.

One day, all who were on the island, except the king and queen and one servant, went out to fish.

About noon a ragged beggar came to the king's door, and asked for food.

The king called the servant, and asked, "How much food have we in the house?" "My lord," said the servant, "We have only one loaf and a little wine." Then the king gave thanks to God, and said, "Give half of the loaf and half of the wine to this poor man." The servant did as he was bidden.

The beggar thanked the king for his kindness, and went on his way.

They had three boats full of fish, and they said, "We have caught more fish today than in all the other days that we have been on this island." The king was glad, and he and his people were more hopeful than they had ever been before.

When night came, the king lay awake for a long time, and thought about the things that had happened that day.

It may all have been a dream, and yet to the king it seemed very real indeed.

In the morning the king arose early, and crossed over to the mainland.

King Alfred ruled wisely and well over all his people for the rest of his days.
