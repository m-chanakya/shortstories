Many years ago there lived in England a wise and good king whose name was Alfred.

At last, after a great battle, the English army was broken up and scattered.

King Alfred fled alone, in great haste, through the woods and swamps.

Late in the day the king came to the hut of a woodcutter.

How was he going to get his army together again? And how was he going to drive the fierce Danes out of the land? He forgot his hunger; he forgot the cakes; he forgot that he was in the woodcutter's hut.

The king must have laughed to himself at the thought of being scolded in this way; and he was so hungry that he did not mind the woman's angry words half so much as the loss of the cakes.
