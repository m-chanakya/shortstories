A hundred years or more after the time of Alfred the Great there was a king of England named Canut√©.

King Canute was a Dane; but the Danes were not so fierce and cruel then as they had been when they were at war with King Alfred.

The great men and officers who were around King Canute were always praising him.

Then another would say, "O king! there can never be another man so mighty as you." And another would say, "Great Canute, there is nothing in the world that dares to disobey you." The king was a man of sense, and he grew very tired of hearing such foolish speeches.

"There is nothing that dares to disobey you, O king!" they said.

The foolish officers were puzzled, but they did not dare to say "No." "Command it, O king! and it will obey," said one.
