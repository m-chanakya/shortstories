The letter had a three-cornered stamp on it, and I thought as soon as I looked at it, "That's the thing! Stamp collecting! I'll devote my life to it." I bought an album with accommodation for the stamps of all nations, and began collecting right off.

The first time that I tried it I was full of enthusiasm, and before long my collection numbered quite a few articles of vertu.

It lasted through most of the winter and I was getting quite proud of it, but I took the coins down town one evening to show to a friend and we spent No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 in buying a little dinner for two.

Ancient Indian arrowhead, found by myself the very day after I began collecting.

Ancient Indian bow, found by myself behind a sawmill on the second day of collecting.
