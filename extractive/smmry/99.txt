 It has decreed that irritating "Party cries" shall not be indulged in, and that persons uttering them shall be fined forty shillings and costs.

In the police court reports every day, one sees these fines recorded.

Last week a girl of twelve years old was fined the usual forty shillings and costs for proclaiming in the public streets that she was "a Protestant." The usual cry is, "To hell with the Pope!" or "To hell with the Protestants!" according to the utterer's system of salvation.

It referred to the uniform and inevitable fine of forty shillings and costs for uttering a party cry-and it is no economical fine for a poor man, either, by the way.

"What's that you say?" "To hell with!" "To hell with who? To hell with what?" "Ah, bedad, ye can finish it yourself-it's too expansive for me!" I think the seditious disposition, restrained by the economical instinct, is finely put in that.
