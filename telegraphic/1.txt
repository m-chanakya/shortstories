Readyville
outpost of the Federal army
Woodbury
same relation to the Confederate army
in constant quarrel
One night a squadron of Federal horse commanded by Major Seidel
moved out from Readyville
enterprise requiring secrecy, caution
approached two cavalry videttes
should have been three
"Where is your other man?" said the major
"ordered Dunning to be here"
"He rode forward"
the man replied
"against orders and against sense"
said the officer
expeditionary force
resumed its advance
approached a dense forest
major commanded a halt
rode on alone to reconnoiter
After riding about a hundred yards
reined in his horse
Near the side of the road
stood the figure of a man
dark object
at the man's feet
the officer
drew his saber
no movement in answer to the challenge
the moon burst through
It was Trooper Dunning
The object at his feet
a dead horse
across the animal's neck lay a dead man
the major
about to ride forward
Dunning raised his hand
pointed to
forest
major understood
rode back
returned to the head of his command
"Dunning is just ahead"
"He has killed his man"
"will have something to report"
but Dunning did not come
the day broke
the whole force moved cautiously forward
they found the fallen horse
across the animal's neck
lay the body of Trooper Dunning
abundant evidence
forest had been occupied by
Confederate infantry
