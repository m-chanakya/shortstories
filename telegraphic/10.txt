Bruno did very nice work
But
never
anything
so clever as during that summer
in the hills
there was
Diantha
who posed for him
She was
beautiful
When he
kissed her
she turned red and white and trembled
Bruno sighed
over his work that winter
tried not to think of
Diantha
nothing to keep him from remembering the hills
when summer came again
Bruno gathered his bags
brushes and colors
wondering if
Diantha would quiver red and white again when he called her his sweet own Diantha
before
the wood's edge
he halted
about the little church
people were gathered
He thought Diantha might be among them
she was not
He did see her though
when the doors
swung open
There was a man beside her
Foolish Bruno! to have been only love's harbinger
He turned away
he descended the hill again
to wait
for a train
