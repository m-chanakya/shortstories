gentleman
name was Charney
put into prison wrongfully
time dragged slowly
only pastime
walking
in
prison yard
One
morning
Charney
taking his walk
stopped
seed
fallen between the stones
sprouted
about to crush it
"must not harm it."
next day
two leaves
Every morning after
Charney went
to
plant
Every day
watched Picciola, as he had named the plant
As
summer passed
Picciola
more lovely every day
But one
morning it began to droop
stones of
yard
not let the plant live
must be taken up at once
jailer dared not do
Charney could not sleep
thought came to Charney
ask
Napoleon, the emperor
to save his plant
hard
ask
favor of
man who
shut him up in
prison
wrote his
story
gave it
girl, who promised
carry it to Napoleon
news came
stones
to be taken up
emperor's
wife
heard the story
she said
"no good to keep such a man in prison."
Charney
set free
saw how God
cared
how kind
hearts of even rough men
