"When you're going away by boat," said Mitchell
"say good-bye to the women at home"
"to the chaps at the last pub"
"I hate waiting on the wharf or up on deck when the boat's behind time"
"no sense in it"
"unnecessary misery"
"friends wait on the wharf"
"Some"
"because they love you"
"some"
"don't like you"
"going away without seeing the last of you"
"you hang out"
"because it would hurt 'em"
"you curse the boat"
"wish"
"it would start"
"those who love you most"
"women-folk"
"hang out the longest"
"when I was knocking about the coasts"
"an old aunt"
"persisted"
"to see the last of me"
"bringing the whole family too"
"I was her favourite"
"I"
"turned up"
"in a few months"
"but if I'd come back every next boat"
"wouldn't have made"
"difference to her"
"She'd say"
"I mightn't come back some day"
"she'd never forgive herself"
"for not seeing me off"
"She was old-fashioned"
"dressed like a fright"
"they said"
"They hated being seen in public with her"
"I felt a bit ashamed"
"too"
"at times"
"wouldn't be"
"now"
"When I'd get her off on to the wharf I'd be overcome with my feelings"
"God bless her"
"I never lost anything by her seeing the last of me"
