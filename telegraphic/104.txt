an old man
sat on
steps of the railroad station in
Kentucky town
A well dressed man
approached
stood before him
old man became self-conscious
His smile
like
young child
face
sunken
wrinkled
huge nose
"Have you any coughs, colds, consumption or bleeding sickness?" he asked
stranger shook his head
old man arose
"sickness that bleeds is"
"nuisance"
put his hand on
stranger's arm
laughed
"I cure them all"
"take warts from the hand"
"I charge nothing"
"my name is Tom"
"do you like me?"
stranger was cordial
nodded
old man became reminiscent
"father was a hard man"
"like me, a blacksmith by trade"
"I married against his will"
"he said"
"I do not like that girl"
"I will give you no money"
"We had no money"
"marriage cost twenty-one dollars"
"She is dead"
old man looked at the sky
"I paint beautiful pictures"
"give them away"
"My brother is in the penitentiary"
"killed a man who called him an ugly name"
old man held his hands before
face of
stranger
black with grime
"I pick out warts," he explained
"I play on an accordion"
"You are thirty-seven years old"
"I sat beside my brother"
"He is a pretty"
"'Albert' I said, 'are you sorry you killed a man?'"
"I am not sorry"
"I would kill ten"
"hundred"
"thousand"
old man began to weep
attempted
chew of tobacco
his false teeth became displaced
He covered his mouth
ashamed
"I am old"
"My brother is a bad man"
"full of hate"
"I hate old age"
"ashamed that I am old"
"I have a pretty new wife"
"wrote her four letters"
"she replied"
"we married"
"I love"
"her walk"
"I buy her pretty clothes"
"Her foot is not straight"
"first wife is dead"
"I pick warts off"
"I cure coughs, colds, consumption"
"sickness that bleeds"
"people can write to me"
"I answer"
"all is free"
Again
wept
stranger tried to comfort
"You are a happy man?" the stranger asked
"Yes"
"good man too"
"Ask everywhere"
"my name is Tom, a blacksmith"
"my wife walks prettily"
"she has a twisted foot"
"bought her a long dress"
"she is thirty"
"I am seventy-five"
"she has many pairs of shoes"
"I have bought them"
"her foot is twisted"
"She thinks"
"everybody thinks Tom does not know"
"bought her a long dress"
"my name is Tom, a blacksmith"
"I hate old age"
"take warts off"
"people may write"
"I answer"
"all is free"
