battle was being fought
ground
covered with dead
dying men
air was hot
stifling
One of these soldiers was a nobleman
loved for his gentleness and kindness
now he was no better off than the poorest man in the field
He
wounded
would die
suffering
with pain
thirst
When
battle was over
his friends hurried to his aid
soldier came
with a cup
"I have brought"
"cool water"
cup was placed to Sir Philip's lips
thankfully he looked at the man
Then his eyes met
a dying soldier
close by
"Give the water to that man"
said Sir Philip
a brave
noble man he was
always had
good of others in his mind
everybody wept
when
heard
he was dead
