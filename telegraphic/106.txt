in England
knight
Sir Walter Raleigh
When Raleigh
young
walking along a street
wore a
scarlet cloak
came to a puddle of muddy water
could not step across
on the other side
Queen
Young Raleigh
thought only of helping the queen
took off his
cloak
spread it across the puddle
She walked across
thanked the young man
she sent for Raleigh to come to her palace
the queen made him a knight
