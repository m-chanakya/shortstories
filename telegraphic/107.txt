Once upon a time
was a cat
Mr. Puff
lived in a grand house
close to
Turkish Embassy. A lord
a lady
several servants lived with Mr. Puff; he was very kind to them
One day Mr. Puff
found a poor little kitten, covered with mud
crying
Mr. Puff took the kitten
home
The lord and
lady had
kitten washed
gave it food
called it Smut.
Smut grew to be a cat
the lord and
lady
spoke, "We"
"friend," they said
"catless"
"if Mr. Puff"
"agree"
"take Smut to him as"
"present."
Mr. Puff agreed. So Smut
taken to
friend's house. The dear friend had a little girl
when she saw Smut, she cried out for joy,
when Smut grew up, his gravity and dignity made all who knew his history wonder
that he had once been a dirty kitten
glad to accept the charity of Mr. Puff
year had gone
great war in Turkey
terrible battles were fought
Smut
anxious, and went
bald
none could tell why
he died
all who had known him grieved
And when Smut had been sleeping only a little while
accident revealed that
he had been of high degree
the Turkish Ambassador's coachman's wife's cat's kitten.
