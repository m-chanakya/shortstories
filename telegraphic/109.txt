I stood near hill cliff
saw the sun sinking
into dusk
Everybody
expecting me at home
I tried to remember
last time I saw a sunset
I came
same place with grandma six years ago
used to enjoy my visit
with her
it used to elate me to see the smile on her face
most cherished site of my life
She once said
she would love to die watching this
One day while returning from the hill
she had a stroke
she died
shock to me
Since then hatred
for this place
Yet, today
hill side reminded me of her
she is no more
her memories
forever
everyday this sun would set
remind me of her
Slowly
I came back from my reminiscence
started walking
towards my home
