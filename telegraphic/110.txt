lived
poor farmer
aged
mother
Shining
governed by
leader who
shrinking from
failing health
strength
strict orders
put to death
aged people
farmer loved his
mother
But no one ever thought twice about
mandate
at sundown
lifted his
mother to his back
started
up the mountain
road
crossed
by many paths
some places, they got lost
On he went
mother
noted the reckless hastening
snapping the twigs from brushes
dropped a handful every few steps
summit was reached
with tearful eyes
he said farewell
She said
"follow"
"the piles of twigs"
"guide you"
"down"
he cried
"your kindness breaks my heart!"
"will not leave you"
Beneath the kitchen floor
walled closet
There the son hid his mother
Time passed
governor sent
order
subjects
present him
rope of ashes
son whispered the news to his
mother
"Make rope of twisted straw"
"stretch it upon"
"flat stones"
"burn it"
"windless night"
did as she said
governor
pleased
demanded to know where
obtained
wisdom
he related his story
governor listened
"Shining needs more than strength of youth," he said
the cruel law was abolished
