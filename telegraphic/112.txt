Once upon a time
severe plague
among
animals. Many died
who lived were
ill
they cared
neither food nor drink
dragged themselves about
the Lion decided to call a council
all the animals
gathered
he arose and said:
"gods have sent this plague upon us as a punishment"
"most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice"
"I"
"confess"
"sins first. I"
"very greedy"
"devoured many sheep"
"eaten goats and bulls and stags"
"even ate up a shepherd"
"if I"
"most guilty, I am ready to be sacrificed"
"it best that each one confess his sins"
"we can decide"
"who is the most guilty."
the Fox, "you are too good"
"You have done them great honor by eating them up.
animals applauded
Fox loudly.
Tiger
Bear
Wolf, and
savage beasts recited
wicked deeds, all were excused and made to appear
innocent.
now the Ass's turn
he said guiltily
"passing a field belonging to"
"priests, I"
"tempted by"
"grass and"
"hunger, that I"
"nibbling a bit of it"
A great uproar among
beasts
Here
the culprit
horrible crime
enough to hang anyone for
they
made an end to him, sacrificing him
then and there
without
an altar.
The weak
made to suffer for
misdeeds of the powerful.
