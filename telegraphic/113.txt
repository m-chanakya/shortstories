Dog was a favorite
received many a pat
from
Master
Every day
Dog would run to meet
Master
frisking playfully
leaping up to lick his hands and face
Ass saw with
discontent
Though
well fed
he had much work
Master hardly
took
notice of him
jealous Ass got it into his
head
to win
Master's favor
act like the Dog
one day he left
stable
clattered
into the house
Finding his Master
at the dinner table
he kicked up his heels
with a loud bray
pranced
around the table
upsetting it
planted his forefeet on
Master's knees
lick the Master's face
But his weight upset the chair
Ass and man rolled over
Master was
alarmed
calling for help
servants
saw the danger
set upon the Ass
drove him with kicks and blows back to the stable
