Some people
great difficulty in saying good-bye
saddest case
that of
Melpomenus Jones
too modest to tell a lie
too religious to wish to appear rude
he went to call on some friends
first afternoon of his summer vacation
chatted awhile
then braced himself
"I think I..."
lady of the house said
"stay a little longer?"
he said, "of course"
Night was falling. He rose again
said the lady
"perhaps"
"stayed to dinner"
After dinner
showed him photographs
At eight-thirty
Jones rose
turned out
child
had hidden Mr. Jones's hat
papa said that he must stay
invited him to a pipe and a chat
papa began to get
tired of Jones
said
with
irony
stay all night
Jones mistook his meaning
papa put Jones to bed
cursed him
After breakfast next day, papa went off
in the evening
surprised
to find Jones still there
jest
charge him for his board
young man
paid him a month's board
sobbed
In the days that followed he was moody
mind was visibly failing
crash came
illness
was terrible
after a month
last day of his vacation
passed away
when the last moment came
"angels are calling"
"must go now"
