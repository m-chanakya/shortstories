rich old man
Barmecide
had everything
poor man
Schacabac
clothing was rags
food which
people
thrown away
had a light heart
happy as a king
Once
Schacabac
not had anything to eat for a long time
thought that he would
ask
Barmecide to help
Schacabac bowed low before him
Barmecide spoke
kindly
asked what was wanted
Schacabac told him
"You must be almost dead with hunger"
"I have plenty and to spare!"
"Bring in the water to wash our hands"
"order the cook to hurry the supper"
Schacabac
not expected to be treated so kindly
began to thank
rich man
"Come and wash with me," he said
Schacabac saw no boy
nor basin
nor water
But he thought
he ought to do as he was bidden
made a pretense of washing
said
Barmecide
"let us have supper"
He sat down
pretended to be carving a roast
"Help yourself"
Schacabac thought that he understood the joke
he made pretense of taking food
said the old man
"bring on the roast goose"
"try this choice piece"
Schacabac
almost dead with hunger
but
too polite not to do as he was bidden
"Did you ever eat anything so delicious?"
"Never in my life," said Schacabac
"Then eat heartily," said the Barmecide
After this came the dessert
"anything else"
asked the host
"no!" said poor Schacabac
"I have
"had"
"plenty"
"Let us drink, then," said the Barmecide
"I will drink no wine"
"it is forbidden"
Barmecide seized him by the hand
"wished to find a man like you," he said
"now we will sup in earnest"
When they had finished
Barmecide said
"you"
"man of good understanding"
"Your wits are quick"
"ready always to make the best of everything"
"live with me"
"manage my house"
so Schacabac lived with the Barmecide many years
never again
hungry
