A store of honey
found in a hollow tree
Wasps declared
it belonged to them
Bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs
argument grew very pointed
they agreed to let a judge decide the matter
they brought the case before the Hornet
witnesses declared that they had seen
winged creatures
who hummed loudly
bodies were striped
yellow and black
Such evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision
he adjourned court for six weeks
When the case came up again
a wise old Bee addressed the Court
"the case has now been pending for six weeks"
"If it is not decided soon, the honey will not be fit for anything"
"I move that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed to build a honey comb"
The Wasps protested loudly
Wise Judge Hornet quickly understood why they did so
They knew they could not build a honey comb
and fill it with honey
"It is clear"
said the Judge
"The honey belongs to the Bees"
