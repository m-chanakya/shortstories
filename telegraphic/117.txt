OLD Uncle Oswald believed he belonged to the Bênitous
no getting the notion out of his head
Monsieur tried every way
been fifty years since
Bênitous owned him
belonged to others since
later been freed
there was not a Bênitou left in the parish now
except one
woman
who lived with her little daughter in
Natchitoches
that made no difference to Uncle Oswald
He was always running away from Monsieur
to get back to
Bênitous
constantly getting injured in such attempts
Monsieur and Doctor Bonfils reluctantly decided
it was time to "do something"
one
morning
Monsieur took Uncle Oswald
to Natchitoches
to take the evening train for the institution
It was
early
when they reached town
Monsieur
tied his horses in front of the hotel
and entered
he left Uncle Oswald seated
within the yard
no one took
notice of the old negro drowsing over the cane
a little girl about twelve
carrying a parcel
passed Uncle Oswald
the old man
half asleep
let fall his cane
She picked it up
handed it back
"thankee"
stammered Uncle Oswald
"W'at 's yo' name"
"Susanne Bênitou"
replied the girl
old negro stumbled to his feet
followed the little one
an hour later
Monsieur
found him
upon
the tiny house
Madame Bênitou
Mother and daughter
perplexed to comprehend
intentions of the venerable servitor
Monsieur understood
situation at once
prevailed upon Madame Bênitou to accept
services of Uncle Oswald for the sake of
old darky's own safety and happiness
Oswald never tries to run away now
chops wood
hauls water
bears the parcels
Susanne used to carry
