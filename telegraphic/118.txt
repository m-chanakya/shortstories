It was Serozha's birthday
he received many
gifts
But
uncle gave him
gift
he prized above all
a trap for snaring birds
he ran
to show his mother
His mother said
"not a good plaything"
"What do you want to do with birds?"
"put them in a cage"
Serozha said
He
set the trap in the garden
stood by
But
birds were afraid of him
Serozha ran in
to eat
left the cage
After dinner he went to look
cage had shut
in it a little bird
"I have caught a bird!" he cried
His mother said
"Be careful"
"Don't hurt it"
"better let it go"
"No"
he said
put the bird in a cage
for two days gave it seed and water
cleaned the cage
But on the third day he forgot
his mother said
"See"
"you have forgotten your bird"
"better let it go"
Serozha
cleaned the cage
he went to get
water
mother saw
he had forgotten to shut the cage door
"shut up your cage"
"else your bird will fly out and hurt itself"
bird found the door
flew
toward the window
Serozha came
picked up the bird
put it back in the cage
it lay on its breast
wings spread
breathed heavily
Serozha
began to cry
"what can I do now?" he asked
"nothing"
she replied
Serozha stayed by the cage
all the time
bird lay
breathed hard
When Serozha went to bed
bird was dead
Serozha could not get to sleep for a long time
After that Serozha never again snared birds
