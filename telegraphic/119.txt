time of King Robert Bruce
lived a brave man
Douglas
His hair
beard
black
long
face
tanned
dark
people nicknamed him
Black Douglas
In the war with the English
Douglas did many brave deeds
English people
afraid of him
Women would tell their children
when they were naughty
Black Douglas would get them
this
make them
quiet
good
castle in Scotland
English had taken
in the war
Scottish
wanted
to take it again
Douglas and his men went
a holiday
English soldiers in the castle
having a merry time
But
they had left watchmen on the wall
In the evening
wife of one of the soldiers went up on the wall with her child
she saw
dark objects moving toward
foot of the wall
she pointed them out to
watchmen
"nothing to frighten us"
"They are"
"farmer's cattle"
But the dark objects were
Douglas and his men
dragging ladders
soon be climbing to the top of the wall
woman watched them until the last one had passed
out of sight
She was not afraid
in the
twilight they looked indeed like cattle
she began to sing to her child
"hush ye"
"do not fret ye"
"Douglas shall not get ye"
a gruff voice
behind her
"Don't be so sure"
She looked around
there stood
Douglas
same moment a Scottish soldier
leaped upon the wall
then
another
wall was covered with them
there was hot fighting
English
taken by surprise
could not do much
in a little while
Douglas and his men were the masters of the castle
the woman and her child
Douglas would not suffer any one to harm them
they went back to England
