Palace of Saint Nicholas in the Moon Christmas Morning
Dear Susy Clemens,
I
read all
letters which you
have written me
I had trouble with those letters which you dictated through your mother
I made no mistakes about the things which you
ordered in your own letters
delivered them all myself
But there were
orders which I could not
a word or two in your mama's letter
I took to be "a trunk full of doll's clothes." Is that it? I will call at your kitchen door
this morning to inquire
I must not see anybody
must
speak to
you
Then
go
to
nursery
stand on
chair
put your ear to
tube that leads
to
kitchen
when I whistle through it
say, "Welcome, Santa Claus!"
I will ask
was a trunk you ordered
If
it was, I
ask
what color
and
you must tell me every single thing
you want the trunk to contain. Then when I say "Good-by"
you
say "Good-by"
Then
go
library and make George close all
doors
into
main hall
everybody
keep still
little while. I will
get those things and
come down the chimney
in the hall
If I
leave
snow
tell George to sweep
If my boot
stain
Leave it there always in memory of my visit; and whenever you look
remind
be a good little girl
