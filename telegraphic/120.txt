once six blind men
stood
road-side every day, and begged
heard of elephants
never seen one
being blind, how could they?
one morning
an elephant
driven down the road where they stood.
they asked the driver to let him stop so that they might see him.
they thought
by touching
learn just what kind of animal he was.
first one
put his hand
elephant's side
he said
"exactly like a wall."
second felt
elephant's tusk
he said, "you are mistaken"
"more like a spear than anything else."
third
hold
elephant's trunk. "Both"
"wrong," he said
"this elephant is like a snake."
fourth
grasped one of
elephant's legs
"he is round and tall like a tree."
fifth was a very tall
he
hold
elephant's ear
"He is exactly like a huge fan."
sixth
At last he seized the
tail
"foolish fellows!" he cried
"he is exactly like a rope."
the elephant moved on
six blind men
quarreled about him. Each believed
he knew
how the animal looked
each called the others
names because
did not agree
People who have eyes sometimes act as foolishly
