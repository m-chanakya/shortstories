Greece was in danger
mighty army
led by
King of Persia
in a few days
be in Greece
king
messengers into every city
bidding them give him water and earth in token that
land
sea were his
But they said
"No: we will be free"
men armed themselves
to go out
drive back their foe
only one way
Persian army
could go into Greece on that side
a narrow pass
pass was guarded by Leonidas
King of the Spartans
with three hundred Spartan soldiers
Persian soldiers
so many
no man could count them
yet Leonidas and
Spartans held their ground
Bravely they faced their foes
Persians came forward
to meet death
But one by one the Spartans fell
All day long
Persians
kept at bay
when the sun went down
not one Spartan left alive
Twenty thousand Persian soldiers had fallen
Greece was saved
Thousands of years have passed
but men still
tell the story of Leonidas
who died for their country
