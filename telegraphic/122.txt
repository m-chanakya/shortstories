Very often
after a violent thunderstorm
field of buckwheat appears blackened
country people say
this
is caused by lightning
but I will tell you what
sparrow says
sparrow
heard it from
old willow tree
It is
large
trunk has been split
out of the crevice grass
brambles grow
Corn grows in the surrounding fields
The corn has a smiling look
heaviest
ears bend their heads
as if in
humility
Once there was
a field of buckwheat
opposite to old willow tree
buckwheat did not bend
erected its head proudl
"I am as valuable as"
"corn"
"handsomer"
"you know of anything prettier"
"old willow tree?"
willow tree nodded
buckwheat spread itself
with pride
said
"Stupid tree"
There arose a
terrible storm
All
field flowers
folded their leaves
bowed their little heads
while the storm passed
buckwheat stood erect in its pride
"Bend your head"
said the flowers
cried the ears of corn
said the old willow tree
"Do not look at the lightning"
"In a"
"lightning heaven opens"
"we can look in"
"but the sight will strike even human beings blind"
"What"
"must happen to us"
"who"
"are so inferior to them"
"Inferior, indeed!" said the buckwheat
"Now I intend to have a peep"
he looked up
while the lightning flashed
When
storm had passed
flowers and the corn raised their
heads
but the buckwheat lay
burnt
by the lightning
branches of the old willow tree rustled
water drops fell from his green leaves as if
willow were weeping
sparrows asked why
willow told them of
pride of the buckwheat
punishment which followed
