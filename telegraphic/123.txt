There was
a Cat
was
watchful
a Mouse hardly dared show
for fear of being eaten
That Cat seemed
everywhere
claws
ready for
pounce.
the Mice kept
to
dens
the Cat
would have to use his wits
to catch one.
one day he climbed
on a shelf and hung
head downward, as if
dead
the Mice
saw him
thought he
in punishment
timidly
stuck out
heads
nothing stirred
trooped joyfully
celebrate
death of
Cat.
Cat let go
before
Mice recovered from
surprise, he had made an end of three or four.
Now
Mice
more strictly at home
But
Cat
still hungry
knew more tricks
Rolling
in flour
he was covered
he lay down
flour bin, with one eye open
Mice
began to come out
when
Rat, who had
much experience
sat up
"Take care!" he cried.
"it looks"
"like the Cat"
"wisest to keep"
"distance."
The wise do not let themselves be tricked a second time.
