SOME children
in their playground
herald
crying aloud
"the King passes by this road today"
"He may"
"see our playground"
"We must put it in order"
labored hard, till at length all was clean
"we must make it pretty, too"
When all was done the playground was so beautiful
"Let us keep it always like this"
waited
for
King
never came
only
man
kind, tired
"May I come in and rest"
set him on the seat
look like a throne
"We made it pretty for the King"
"now we mean to keep it so"
such kind eyes
told him all they knew
thanked the children
went on his way
"How the sun shines on his hair"
"like a crown of gold"
