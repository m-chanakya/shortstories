ONE fine evening
a
government clerk
Ivan Dmitritch Tchervyakov
sitting in
stalls, gazing through
opera glass
felt
bliss.
But suddenly his face puckered up
eyes disappeared

bent over

not reprehensible
to sneeze anywhere.
Tchervyakov

confused, he wiped

looked round to see whether he had disturbed any one
then he
overcome
confusion. He saw
gentleman sitting in front of him
wiping his
head and
neck
the
gentleman
a civilian general
in the Department of Transport
"I have spattered him," thought Tchervyakov, "he"
"not"
"my department, but still"
"awkward"
"must apologise."
Tchervyakov
bent
forward, and whispered in the general's ear.
"I spattered you accidentally"
"Never mind"
"For goodness sake excuse me"
"let me listen"
Tchervyakov

fell to gazing at the stage.

went up to Brizzhalov
muttered:
"I spattered"
"forgive me"
"Oh, that's enough"
said the general
"there is a fiendish light in his eye," thought Tchervyakov,
"And he doesn't want to talk"
"ought to explain"
"or else he will think I meant to spit on him"
home, Tchervyakov told his wife
"you had better"
"apologise," she said
"I did apologise, but he took it somehow queerly"
Next day Tchervyakov
went to Brizzhalov's to explain;
the general
looked at Tchervyakov.
"Yesterday"
"I sneezed"
"accidentally spattered"
"What can I do for you," said the general addressing the next
Tchervyakov
"that means that he is angry"
"I will explain to him."
When
general
finished
Tchervyakov took a step towards him and muttered:
"It was not intentional"
"graciously believe me."
The general
waved his hand.
"Why, you are simply making fun of me, sir," he said
as he closed
door
"If that is how it is I am not going to apologise"
"any more"
thought Tchervyakov as he walked home

"I did not dream of making fun of you. Should I"
"then there would be no respect for persons"
"Be off!" yelled the general
