M'sié Jean-Ba'
Aurélia's father
was so
fine
imposing
he could easily
ridden in the car "For Whites"
No one would
have known
But
Jean-Ba' was too proud
So was Ma'ame Jean-Ba'
because of that
Aurélia's existence
not
happy
She
not permitted to play with
white children
who would willingly have
her join
Neither
with
little darkies who frolicked
before their cabin
There seemed nothing for her to do
so long as she was a baby
satisfied to play with a sunbeam
growing older she pined for
real companionship
Jean-Ba'
noted
daughter's drooping mien
Jean-Ba' could not stand that
when
his contract
had ceased
he gathered his family
went away to live
in paradise
the change is so wonderful
constant making and receiving of visits
every morning
convent where
children just like herself
taught by the sisters
church in which
make their Sunday devotions
atmosphere which is native
galloping about the country on little creole ponies
happiest little Free-Mulatto in all Louisiana is Aurélia
since her father
moved to "L'Isle des Mulâtres
