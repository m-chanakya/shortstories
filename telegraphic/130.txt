A Dog and a Cock
were the best of friends
wished
to see
world
decided to leave
farmyard
set out
to the woods
At nightfall the Cock
spied
a hollow tree
for a night's lodging
Dog could creep inside
Cock would fly up on one of the branches
both slept
comfortably
dawn the Cock awoke
thought he was still in the farmyard
it had been his duty to arouse the household
So
he
crowed lustily
he awakened a Fox
Fox
had
visions of
delicious breakfast
Hurrying to the tree
said
"welcome to our woods"
"we shall become the closest of friends"
"I feel highly flattered"
replied the Cock slyly
"go around to the door"
"my porter will let you in"
hungry but unsuspecting Fox
went around
Dog
seized him
Those who
deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin
