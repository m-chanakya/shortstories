There is a story
I cannot tell it
have no words
story concerns
three men
in a room
One is young and dandified
continually laughs
second man
has a long white beard
is consumed with doubt
third man
has wicked eyes
moves nervously
three men are waiting
Upstairs
a woman standing
back to a wall
in half darkness
fourth man came to the house
white silent man
went upstairs to the woman
woman upstairs craved love
When the white silent man came
she sprang forward
smile on her lips
white one said nothing
His eyes were
impersonal
Down stairs
wicked one whined
ran back and forth
grey one tried to follow
grew tired
lay down
to sleep
never awoke again
dandified fellow lay on the floor too
laughed
white silent one may have been Death
waiting eager woman may have been Life
old grey bearded man
the wicked one puzzle me
cannot understand them
Most of the time
I do not think of them
I keep thinking about
dandified man
If I could understand him I could understand everything
I would no longer be dumb
I have a wonderful story
no way to tell it
