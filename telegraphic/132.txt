In the Far East
king
had no work
all day
he sat
listened to stories
no matter what the story was about
he never grew tired
"only one fault that I find with your story"
he often said
"it is too short"
king
always sad when
story
ended
he sent word into every city
town
country place
"To the man that will tell"
"story which shall last forever"
"I will give my fairest daughter"
"make him my heir"
"If any man shall try"
"then fail"
"he shall have his head cut off"
king's daughter was very pretty
many young men
willing to do anything to win her
But none
wanted to lose their heads
only a few tried
One
man invented a story that lasted three months
but
could think of nothing more
His fate was a warning to others
one day a stranger from the South came
began his tale
"Once upon a time"
"king seized"
"all the corn in his country"
"stored it"
"in a strong granary"
"a swarm of locusts came"
"found"
"a crevice"
"just large enough for one locust"
"one locust went in"
"carried away a grain of corn"
Day after day
man kept on saying
"another locust went in"
"carried away a grain of corn"
At the end of two years
king said
"How much longer"
said the story-teller
"they have"
"cleared only one cubit"
"there are many thousand cubits"
cried the king
"you will drive me mad"
"I can listen to it no longer"
"Take my daughter"
"be my heir"
so
story-teller married the king's daughter
lived happily
for many years
king
did not care to listen to any more stories
