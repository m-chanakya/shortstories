two cocks
one on the dunghill
other on the roof
They were both arrogant
poultry yard
divided by
planks from another yard in which
was a dunghill
on the dunghill
grew a large cucumber
conscious of being a hotbed plant
"Not all can be born cucumbers"
"there must be other things, too"
"I have a great opinion of"
"yard cock"
"he is"
"of much more importance than"
"weather cock who is placed so high"
"can't even"
"crow"
"has neither hens nor chicks"
"only thinks of himself"
"perspires verdigris"
"yard cock"
"really a cock"
"His step is a dance"
"crowing is music"
"Even if he ate me"
"it would be a happy death"
said the cucumber
In the night
terrible storm
hens
chicks
cock sought shelter
tiles came tumbling down
but
weather cock sat firm
did not even turn
for he could not
he was young
freshly cast
had been born old
did not
resemble the birds
sparrows
swallows
he despised them
He admitted
pigeons
looked like
weather cock
but they were fat and stupid
their thoughts
directed to filling themselves
tiresome
to converse with
birds of passage
told him of foreign countries
airy caravans
robber stories
interesting
the first time
afterwards
they repeated
all were stale
small-minded
"world is no good!" he said
"Everything"
"stupid"
"What do you think of that crowing?" said
yard cock to
hens
chickens
"a little rough"
"wanted elegance"
hens and chickens came up
dunghill
cock strutted about like a lord
"Garden plant!" he said to
cucumber
eating it up
"A happy death!"
hens and the chickens
were proud
he was
their kind
he crowed
announced a great
news
"A cock can lay an egg!"
"in that egg"
"A basilisk"
"a champion of all cocks I am"
yard cock flapped his wings
made his comb swell up
hens
chicks
proud
clucked
chirped till the weather cock heard
"Everything is very stupid"
weather cock said
"The yard cock lays no eggs"
"I am"
"lazy to do so"
"if I liked"
"I could lay a wind-egg"
"But"
"world is not worth even a wind-egg"
"I don't want to sit here any longer"
weather cock broke off
he did not kill the yard cock
although
hens said that
his intention
