In the morning of life came a good fairy with her basket
"Here are gifts"
"Take one"
"chose wisely"
"only one"
"is valuable"
gifts were five: Fame, Love, Riches, Pleasure, Death
youth said, eagerly
"no need to consider"
he chose Pleasure
He went out
sought
pleasures
youth delights in
But each
short-lived
disappointing
In the end he said
"These years I have wasted"
"If I could"
"choose again"
"I would choose wisely"
fairy appeared
"Four of the gifts remain"
"Choose once more"
man considered long
chose Love
did not mark the tears
in the fairy's eyes
After many, many years
man sat by a coffin
empty home
"One by one they have gone away"
"left me"
"for each hour of happiness"
"I have paid a thousand hours of grief"
"Choose again"
It was the fairy
"years have taught you wisdom"
"surely"
"Three gifts remain"
man reflected long
chose Fame
fairy
sighing
went her way
Years went by
"My name filled the world"
"praises"
"on every tongue"
"seemed well"
"for a little while"
"Then came envy"
"detraction"
"calumny"
"hate"
"persecution"
"derision"
last of all came pity"
"Chose yet again"
"Two gifts remain"
"but one that was precious"
"still here"
"Wealth"
"is power"
said the man
"I will spend"
"squander"
"dazzle"
"mockers"
"despisers will crawl"
"before me"
"will feed my hungry heart with their envy"
"I will buy"
"respect"
"esteem"
"worship"
Three short years went by
man sat shivering in a
garret
gaunt
wan
hollow-eyed
clothed in rags
"They are not gifts"
"merely lendings"
"disguises for lasting realities"
"Pain, Grief, Shame, Poverty"
"fairy said true"
"one gift which was precious"
"Bring it! I am weary"
fairy came
bringing again four of the gifts
Death was wanting
"I gave it to"
"a little child"
"It was ignorant"
"but trusted me"
"asking me to choose"
"You did not ask"
"What is left for me?"
"wanton insult of Old Age"
