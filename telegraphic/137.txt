They were sitting
in front of me
I was
able to hear all that they were saying
both
considered themselves
a ripe thinker
"I've been reading some very interesting statistics"
"Ah, statistics" said the other
"very fond of them"
first man went on
"a drop of water is filled with little"
"what you call them"
"every cubic inch containing--er--"
"Say a million," said the other
"or possibly a billion"
"Now, coal...take coal..."
"every ton of coal"
"will drag a train"
"as long as...I forget the exact length"
"but say"
"such and such a length"
"weighing"
"say so much...from..."
"exact distance escapes me"
"From here to the moon," suggested the other
"very likely; yes"
"But the most stupendous calculation"
"distance from the earth to the sun"
"a cannon-ball--er--fired at the sun..."
"Fired at the sun," nodded the other
as if he had often seen it done
"travelling at the rate of..."
"three cents a mile," hinted the listener
"No, no"
"at a fearful rate"
"would take"
"hundred million--"
"no"
"a hundred billion"
"in short"
"long time in getting there"
At this point I could stand no more
I interrupted
and passed into the smoking-car
