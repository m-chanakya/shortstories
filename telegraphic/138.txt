A Fox
caught in a trap
succeeded
after much painful tugging
But he had to leave his
tail behind
For a long time he kept away from
other Foxes
he knew
they would all make fun
But it was hard
to live alone
he thought of a plan
He called a meeting of all the Foxes
When they
gathered
made a long speech about
Foxes who
come to harm because of their tails
one had been caught by hounds when his tail
entangled in
hedge
one had not been able to run fast
because of
weight
men hunt Foxes
for
tails
With such proof of the danger
of
tail
he
advise every Fox to cut it off
When he had finished
an old Fox
said
"Master Fox, kindly turn around"
When
Fox Without a Tail turned around
there arose
jeers and hooting
Do not listen to
advice of him who seeks to lower you to his own level
