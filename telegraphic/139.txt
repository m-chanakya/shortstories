On

looked like any common farmhouse
One day

"have earned a holiday"
"try to learn some good thing"
started off to find the house with the golden windows
he came to
hill

woman came to the door
"windows"
"only glass"
"We are poor farming people," she said
she called her daughter
little girl

boy asked her about the golden windows
she knew all about them
"have come"
"the wrong way!"
went to a knoll
girl told
the golden windows could only be seen
about sunset
the girl
pointed
the boy saw that it was his own home
told the little girl that he must go
dark before
boy reached his
house
"have you learned anything?" asked his father
"our house has windows of gold"
