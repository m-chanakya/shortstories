story of David William Duck
an old man living in Aurora, Illinois
commonly known
as "Dead Duck."
"In"
"1866 I was a private soldier"
"stationed at Fort Phil Kearney"
"I was trying to make my way with important dispatches to Fort C. F. Smith"
"As the country swarmed with hostile Indians, I traveled by night"
"I went afoot, armed with a Henry rifle"
"For my second place of concealment I chose what seemed"
"narrow canon"
"it was near midday, when I was awakened by"
"a rifle"
"A band of Indians"
"had me nearly surrounded"
"I ran"
"dodging"
"bullets"
"The rascals did not"
"pursue"
"I reached"
"the head of the gulch"
"I had mistaken for a canon"
"I was caught"
"they had only to wait"
"For two days and nights"
"I fought the fellows at long range, firing occasionally"
"I did not dare to close my eyes at night"
"the morning of the third day"
"I sprang out into the open and began firing"
"I remember no more of that fight"
"The next thing that I recollect was my pulling myself out of a river"
"I had not a rag of clothing"
"all that night I traveled"
"At daybreak I found myself at Fort C. F. Smith"
"I met"
"a sergeant named William Briscoe, whom I knew very well"
"You can fancy his astonishment at seeing me"
"my own at his asking who"
"I was"
"'Dave Duck,' I answered"
"I told him what had happened to me"
"then he said"
"I buried you two months ago"
"I'll show you your clothing"
"letters that I took from your person"
"He showed me the clothing, which I"
"put on"
"the letters, which I put into my pocket"
"took me to the commandant, who"
"ordered Briscoe to take me to the guardhouse"
"Briscoe, did you really"
"bury the dead body"
"'Sure,' he answered"
"you'd better tell me who you are."
"A week later, I escaped from the guardhouse"
"Twice I have been back, seeking"
"that fateful spot"
"but unable to find it"
