A gray hare lived during the winter near a village
When night came
he would prick up
ear and listen
sit up
on his hind legs
look all around
nothing was to be seen except snow
hare was obliged to make
circuit across the highway to reach his favorite granary
hare paused near the road
peasants were walking alongside of their sledges
As soon as
teams
passed
hare crossed the road
leaped unconcernedly toward the threshing-floor
A little dog
caught sight of the hare
began to bark
darted after him
snow impeded the hare
even the dog
gave up the chase
hare also stopped
proceeded at his leisure
On the way across the field he fell in with two other hares
gray hare joined
helped them clear
snow
ate a few seeds of winter wheat
went on his way
In the village
all quiet
fires were out
hare hastened to the threshing-floor
found some of his mates
played with them
ate some oats
mounted the
roof into the granary
went
toward his hole
dawn was already beginning
women woke up
went out after water
peasants began carrying fodder
children were shouting
Along the highway
more teams passed
hare leaped across the road
went to his old hole
dug away the snow
curled into the depths
went to sleep with his eyes wide open
