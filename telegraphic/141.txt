ONCE the Play Angel came into a nursery where four
children sat
with sad
faces
"What is the matter"
asked the Play Angel
"We wanted"
"a grand feast"
said
child
"that would be delightful"
said
Angel
"But"
"only one cookie"
said
child
said
Angel
"we have the feast just the same"
"we can manage it"
She broke
cookie into four pieces
gave one piece to the littlest child
"This is a roast chicken"
"brown and crispy"
"cranberry sauce on one side"
"and on the other"
"mashed potato"
Angel gave a piece to the next child
"Here"
"is a little pie"
"brown and crusty"
"inside it"
"chicken and ham and jelly and hard-boiled eggs"
"here," said the Angel to the third child
"is a round cake"
"frosting is half an inch thick"
"inside"
"inside there are chopped-up almonds"
"raisins"
"great slices of citron"
"prettiest cake I ever saw"
Angel gave
last piece to
child whose nursery it was
"Here is an ice-cream rabbit"
"snow-white outside"
"inside"
"pink"
"when I clap my hands and count"
"you must eat the feast"
children ate the feast
"Did ever you see such a grand feast?"
"never we did"
said all
children
"there are some crumbs left over"
said the Angel
"we will give them to"
"birds"
"But you didn't have any"
said
child
"yes"
said the Angel
"I had it all"
