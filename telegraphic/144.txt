"I was sitting"
said the judge
"holding court"
"trying a"
"wicked-looking Spanish desperado for killing the husband of a bright, pretty Mexican woman"
"It was a lazy summer day"
"None of us took"
"interest in the trial except"
"Mexican woman because"
"loved her husband"
"there warn't any interest in a murder trial"
"because the fellow was always brought in 'not guilty,'"
"jury expecting him to do as much for them some time"
"although the evidence"
"against this Spaniard"
"we could not convict him"
"But that woman"
"heart set on hanging that Spaniard"
"she would glare on him"
"look up at me in her pleading way"
"search the jury's faces"
"when the jury announced the verdict"
"Not Guilty"
"I told the prisoner he was acquitted"
"woman rose up"
"says she:"
"Judge, do I understand"
"this man is not guilty"
"murdered my husband without any cause before my own eyes"
"children's"
"The same," says I
"she turned on"
"smirking Spanish fool"
"shot him dead in open court"
"That was spirited"
"said the judge admiringly"
"I adjourned court"
"we put on our coats"
"took up a collection for her and her cubs"
"sent them over the mountains to their friends"
