first knight came to the Tower
he saw
door of the Tower was shut
(early in the morning)
laid hold of the door
shook it
set his shoulder to it
thrust
not so much as creak
began to hammer against it
When
out of breath
aware of
merry noise
"I laugh in my bed while I hear him roar"
"more you threaten, I laugh the more"
hammered a while longer
went his way
mid-morn
came a second knight
"Here dwells the wonder of the world"
"Would that she might look upon me"
sound at
upper windows
lattice clicked open
lady who stood there
covered with a jewelled veil
holding a key
"let fall the key"
"then?" said the lady
said the knight
"will open the door"
hand was drawn back
lattice clicked shut
knight sang
for
hours in front of the Tower
rode away
before sunset came the third knight
saw
all the windows were open, though the door was shut
on the grass
lay a jewelled veil
got down from his horse
sat down
before the Tower
after the sun
set
lady came walking
toward the Tower
When the knight saw her he stood up and could say nothing
Long time they looked at each other
lady held out
a key
"What will you do"
"if I give it to you?"
"give it back to you," said he, "until it pleases you to open the door."
"It is yours," said she
