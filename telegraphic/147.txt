In the last remnant of Belgium
yet unconquered by the German
I saw a tall young man
gray
eyes
walked in faded blue uniform
an indomitable light in his eyes
by which I knew
he was a King
"I am sure that you are his Majesty, the King of Belgium."
He bowed
pleasant smile relaxed his tired face
"Pardon"
he answered
"you make the usual mistake"
"If I were"
"King of Belgium"
"I should have"
"only this narrow strip of earth"
"four hundred square miles of debris"
"But, no," he said
"that is not my kingdom"
"My real title"
"is King of the Belgians"
"It was for their honor"
"liberty"
"I was willing to lose my land"
"my crown"
Then ran
through me the thought
how the little Belgian army had fought
Belgian people had suffered
rather than surrender
I remembered how the word of this quiet man
had been the inspiration
of his people through the fierce conflict
"Sir," I said
"you have a glorious kingdom which shall never be taken away"
"as for your land"
"fates"
"against you"
"How will you"
"get back to it?"
"Germans are strong"
"Will you make a peace with them"
"take what they have"
"offered"
"Never," he answered
"it is the way to dishonor"
"When God brings me back, my army and my Queen are going"
"to liberate our people"
"only one way that leads there"
"the King's high way"
"Look"
"you can see the beginning of it down there"
"wish me well on that road"
"for I shall never take another"
he bade me good afternoon
walked away
Looking down
I saw a strip of the straight white road
At the beginning
a broken bridge
in places it seemed torn up by shells
as I looked a vision came
bridge is restored
road mended
on that highway rides the King
Queen
At their approach ruined villages rejoice
They have come home
Not by the low road of cowardly surrender
not by the crooked road of compromise and falsehood
not by the soft road of ease
but by the straight road of
faith
courage
self-sacrifice
the King's High Way
