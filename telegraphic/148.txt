an outcry at
door of
king's great hall
a strong voice shouting, "I will come in! I must see the false king!"
king said, "Let him come in"
a man in
armour
stood in front of the throne
he was weary
angry
afraid
his anger was stronger
looked the king in the face.
very calm
not unkind
king said, "Speak!"
man drew from his breast a golden chain, at the end
great blue stone
threw it down on the steps of the throne
turned
to go.
"Stay," said the king. "Whose is this jewel?"
"yours," said the man.
"Where"
"you get it?" asked the king.
"old servant of yours," answered the man. "He"
"told me it came from"
"king"
"blue stone of"
"Truth, perfect and priceless. Therefore I must keep it"
"and bring it back to"
"king perfect and unbroken."
"And you have done this?" said the king.
"Yes and no," answered the man.
"Divide your answer," said the king. "First, the yes."
"defended it"
"Through storm and peril, through darkness"
"sorrow, through the temptation of pleasure and the bewilderment of riches"
"never parted from it"
"given my life to keep the jewel. This is the meaning of the yes."
"It is right," said the king. "And now the no."
The man answered quickly and with heat.
"jewel is not untarnished, not perfect"
"flaw in the stone"
"a thing of little value"
"not the crystal of Truth"
"been deceived. You"
"claimed my life for a fool's errand"
"Take it. It is yours."
The king looked
at the face of the man
he spoke gently.
"give me my jewel?"
The man
in wonder.
"It is there," he cried, "at your feet!"
"not"
"that," said the king
"of"
"yourself."
"My life," said the man
"not ended?"
"It is begun," said the king. "Your life--yourself, what of that?"
"not thought"
said the man, "only of the jewel"
"Think"
"now," said the king
"you"
"learned courage and hardiness"
"strength"
"wisdom"
"patience"
"stone that has done this for you is false"
"?"
"Is this true?" said the man
sinking on his knee.
"It is true," answered the king
"stand at my right hand. My jewels that I seek are"
"alive. But the stone which led you here--look! has it a flaw?"
He
lifted the jewel
in the
depths of the sapphire the man saw a star.
