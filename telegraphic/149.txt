king of Prussia
Frederick William
On a
morning in June
went out alone to walk in the
woods
he walked among the trees
listen to the singing birds
look at the wild flowers
After a while
he came to a
meadow
children were playing there
It made
king glad
watched them
Then he called them
all sat down
children did not know who
gentleman was
but they liked his kind face
manners
said the king
"I want to ask you some questions"
"child who gives"
"best answer shall have a prize"
he held up an orange
"to what kingdom does"
"orange belong"
children were puzzled
Then a
boy spoke up
"vegetable kingdom"
"Why so"
asked the king
"all plants belong to that kingdom"
said the boy
king was pleased
"have the orange for your prize"
Then he took a
gold piece
"to what kingdom does this belong"
he asked
Another
boy answered
"mineral kingdom"
"metals belong to that kingdom"
"good answer"
said the king
"gold piece is your prize"
children were delighted
eager
"only one more question"
said the king
he stood up
"to what kingdom do I belong"
boys were puzzled now
Some thought
"kingdom of Prussia"
Some
"animal kingdom"
all kept still
At last a tiny
child
said
"to the kingdom of heaven"
King
lifted the little maiden
Tears were in his eyes as he kissed her
"So be it, my child"
