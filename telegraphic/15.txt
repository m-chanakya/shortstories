I once suggested to Rev. Thomas K. Beecher, of Elmira, New York, that we get up a monument to Adam
The matter started as a joke, but
came
near to materializing
long ago
Mr. Darwin's DESCENT OF MAN has been in print five or six years
indignation raised by it was still raging
We had monkeys
but no Adam
Jesting
I said
the world would discard Adam and accept the monkey
this calamity ought to be averted; a monument would accomplish this
Then the unexpected happened
Two bankers
took hold of the matter
because they saw
certain commercial advantages
The bankers discussed the monument
It would be the only monument on the planet to Adam
People would come from every corner of the globe
to look at it
One of the bankers subscribed five thousand dollars
I think the other one subscribed half as much
We got designs made
when it was yet a joke
I had framed a
petition to Congress begging the government to build the monument
It seemed
this petition
now
would advertise our scheme
make our
stock go off briskly
I sent it to General Joseph R. Hawley
in the House
he said he would present it. But he did not do it
he explained that
it was too serious
too sentimental
We ought to have carried out our monument scheme
Elmira would now be the most celebrated town
Very recently I began
a book
one of the minor characters touches
upon a project for a monument to Adam
now the TRIBUNE has come upon
the forgotten jest
mental telegraphy is still in business
