A Lark made her nest in a field of young wheat
As the days passed
wheat
grew
young birds
grew
one day
Farmer
son came into the field
"wheat"
"ready for reaping," said the Farmer
"We must call"
"neighbors and friends to help"
young Larks
were
frightened
Mother Lark returned with food
they told her
"Do not be frightened"
said the Mother Lark
"If the Farmer said he would call"
"neighbors and friends to help"
"wheat will not be reaped for a while yet"
few days later
wheat was so ripe
"If"
"not harvested at once," said the Farmer
"we shall lose half the crop"
"We cannot wait"
"for help"
"Tomorrow we must set to work, ourselves"
When the young Larks told their mother
she said:
"we must be off at once"
"When a man decides to do his own work"
"there will be no more delay"
at sunrise next day
Farmer
son cut down the grain
they found an empty nest
