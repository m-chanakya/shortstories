It was the night
Christ-Child came to Bethlehem
In a country far away
old woman
Babouscka sat in her
house by
warm fire
suddenly she heard
rap at her door
She opened it
three old men standing outside
their arms were full of precious things
"We have travelled far"
they said
"we stop to tell you of the Baby Prince born this night in Bethlehem"
"We carry Him gifts. Come with us"
Babouscka looked at the drifting snow
then
at her cozy room
"It is too late for me"
She went inside
shut the door
old men journeyed on
as Babouscka sat by her fire
she began to think
about the Little Christ
she loved
babies
"tomorrow"
"when it is light"
"I will carry Him some toys"
when it was morning Babouscka
filled her basket with
pretty things
But
Babouscka had forgotten to ask the
old men
the road to Bethlehem
no one could tell her the way
she travelled on and on
for years
but she never found
little Christ
They say
old Babouscka is travelling still
looking for Him
When
Christmas Eve
children
fast asleep
Babouscka comes
she asks
"Is the little Christ-Child here?"
then she turns sorrowfully away
before she leaves she takes a toy from her basket
lays it beside the pillow for a Christmas gift
