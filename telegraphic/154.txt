cold and darkness
poor little girl
walked on with
naked feet
carried
matches
Nobody had bought anything
it was New Year's Eve
In a corner
she seated herself
to go home
did not venture
not sold any matches
from
father
get blows
numbed with cold
match might afford
comfort
drew one out
held her hands over it
seemed
sitting before
stove
flame went out
stove vanished
rubbed another against the wall
wall became transparent
On the table
roast goose
match went out
nothing but
wall
left behind
lighted another
Now
Christmas tree
lights of
rose higher
one fell down
"Someone"
"just dead!"
her
grandmother
told her
star falls
soul ascends to God
another match
there stood
grandmother
rubbed the whole bundle of matches
to be
sure of keeping her grandmother
took the little maiden
both flew
high
with God
in the corner
girl
frozen to death
no one
dreamed
with her grandmother she had entered
new year
