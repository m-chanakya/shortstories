shoe
near
forest
house for the Old Lady and all her children
Old Woman
fond of her children
Strong-arm, the eldest
once dwelt in a nice house
her husband was a wood-cutter, like Strong-arm
there lived in
castle beyond the forest
giant
one day
laid their house in ruins
carried off
wood-cutter
Old Lady and her family went to search for him
where the Giant had met their father
saw an immense shoe
Old Lady thought
take shelter in the shoe
Old Lady never forgot her husband
Strong-arm
proposed to
brothers
set their father free from the Giant
they started for the forest
came in sight of the Giant's Castle
Strong-arm
strode
up to the entrance
walked
across the court-yard
part of the castle in which his father was kept was guarded by a large dragon
Strong-arm
found the monster
sword right through his heart
saw his poor father
called up his brothers
they soon
set him free
Little Old Woman
After her sons had started
gave way to
grief
old witch came up to her
hated the Giant
wished to kill him
took the little Old Lady on her broom
to the Giant's castle
old Witch
afflicted the Giant with corns
in such pain
thought
search
his missing shoe
he came to the spot where the Old Lady
lived
saw his old shoe
thrust his foot into it
children
rushed
scrambled through the door
By this time the witch
Little Old Lady
Strong-arm
father
come up to the spot
shot their arrows
he fell wounded
Strong-arm
cut off his head
built a new house
lived happily
