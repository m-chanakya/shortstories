William
stayed away from school that hot day
"went swimming"
master wrote a note to William's father
gave it to William's brother Joe to carry home
Bill waited for Joe
walked home with him
"you've got a note for father"
"Yes"
"you know what's in it?"
"yes"
"You don't mean to"
"give it to father?"
"I must"
"I promised"
"He needn't never know"
"he will"
"He's coming over"
"Saturday"
"I don't want to get a hiding"
"go without supper tonight"
"I promised to go 'possuming with Johnny"
"You can come, too"
"don't want to cop out"
"if I do I'll run away from home"
Bill walked
moody
Joe in troubled, silence
Bill tried again
but Joe was firm
"I wouldn't do it to you"
Joe thought
Bill had stood up
for him only last week
Joe
troubled
There was a shaft
thirty or forty feet deep
logs
jammed across about five feet down
Joe
snatched the note
threw it in
It fluttered
rested on
piece of the old timber
Bill saw it
seeing their father coming home
they hurried on
Joe
in trouble now
Bill tried to comfort
cheer him
promised never to run away
go to school every day
never to fight
steal
tell lies
But Joe
wouldn't be comforted
in the night Bill woke
found Joe sitting up
crying
"what's the matter, Joe?"
"I never done"
"mean thing like that before"
"wished I'd chucked meself"
"instead"
"master trusted me"
"if he asks"
"tomorrow"
"I'll have to"
"lie"
"Then tell the truth"
"take the hidin'"
"soon be over"
"it won't"
"He won't"
"trust me any more"
"I've never been caned in that school yet"
"if I am I'll never go again"
"why"
"you run away"
"play the wag"
"steal"
"get us all into such trouble"
"mother takes on about it"
"hurts father"
"I've deceived"
"master"
"mother"
"father"
"because you're"
"selfish"
he laid down
cried himself to sleep
Bill lay awake
got up quietly
followed by the dog
He went
to the shaft
let himself down
stooped to pick up the note
Then
rotten timber gave way
They found him
morning
dog attracted the attention
They took him home
father went for a doctor
"I wasn't running away, mother"
"tell father that"
"I want Joe"
"send Joe"
Here I am, Bill," said Joe
"Has the master been yet?"
"No"
"I went for the note"
"logs gave way"
"meant to be back before they was up"
"dropped it"
"inside the bed"
"get it"
"say you forgot it last night"
"say you didn't like to give it"
"that won't be a lie"
"Tell the master"
"I'm sorry"
"never to send no notes no more"
"except by girls"
"Mother!"
"Take"
"blankets off"
"I'm dyin'"
