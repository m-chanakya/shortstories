thousands of English soldiers in Boston
would not let any one go out or come in without their leave
people did not like this
"right to be free men"
Brave men
hurried toward Boston
They said
"If the people of Boston must fight for their liberty, we will help them"
Some
camped in Charlestown
near Boston
From the hills
could watch
soldiers
to defend themselves
bought some powder
stored it at Concord
soldiers heard about this powder
made up their minds
get it
Among the watchers at Charlestown
young man named Paul Revere
friend of his who lived in Boston came to see him
secretly
"soldiers"
"going to Concord to get the powder"
"start this very night"
said Paul Revere
"will stir up all the farmers between here and Concord"
"as soon as the soldiers"
"ready to start, hang a lantern in the tower"
"As soon as I see the light"
"ride out to give the alarm"
When night came
Revere was at the riverside with his horse
Hour after hour he stood and watched
light flashed out from the tower
Away they went
"Up! up!" shouted Paul
"defend yourselves!"
cry awoke the farmers
they took their guns
axes
hurried out
alarm quickly spread
soldiers were surprised
angry because their plans
discovered
When they reached Concord
burned the courthouse
But
did not find the gunpowder
did not feel
safe until
once more in Boston
