a long time ago
an old Miller and
Son
on
way to market with
an Ass
to sell
They drove him
slowly
they thought
better chance to sell
if
in good condition
some travelers laughed
at them
"What foolishness"
"they might as well ride"
Miller did not like to be laughed at
he told
son to
ride
a little farther along
three merchants passed by
they cried
"Respect old age"
"Get down"
"let the old man ride"
Though
Miller was not tired
he made
boy get down
himself to ride
they overtook some women
"Look at the old fool"
exclaimed one
"Perched on the Ass"
"while"
"poor boy has to walk"
Miller felt
vexed
told
Boy to climb up behind him
loud shout went up from another company of people
"What a crime"
"to load"
"beast like that"
Miller and
Son
scrambled down
market place
thrown into an uproar
the two came
carrying
Donkey slung from a pole
many people came up to
laugh and shout
began to kick and bray
as they were crossing a bridge
ropes that held him gave way
he tumbled into the river
Miller
set out sadly for home
