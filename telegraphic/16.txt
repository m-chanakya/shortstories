was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit
delicate and fine
the buttons
shone like stars. He was proud and pleased
beyond measure
so astonished and delighted with it
He wanted to wear it everywhere and show it to all sorts of people
thought
all the places he
visited
all
scenes he
described
tried to imagine
feel of
go
scenes and places wearing his
suit
he wanted to go
wearing it
his mother told him, "No."
he must take great care of his suit
never would he have another
so fine; he must save it
wear it on rare and great occasions
And she
buttons
twisted
with tissue paper
tacked
guards over
wherever the suit was
to come to harm. He hated
what could he do?
he
take off
suit
put it away
as though he gave it up again
was always thinking of wearing it
without
guards, without
tissue paper
never caring
