Once upon a time
lived on the banks of the River Dee a miller
happiest man in England
king heard about him
"I will go"
"talk"
"Perhaps he can tell me how to be happy"
As soon as he stepped inside
mill
he heard
miller singing
"I envy nobody"
"I am as happy as I can be"
"nobody envies me"
"You're wrong"
said the king
"I envy you"
"gladly change places with you"
miller smiled
bowed
"tell me"
said the king
"what makes you so cheerful"
"in your dusty mill"
"while I"
"king"
"sad"
"every day"
miller smiled again
"do not know why you are sad"
"I can"
"tell why I am glad"
"I earn my own bread"
"love my wife"
"children"
"friends"
"they love me"
"I owe not a penny"
said the king
"Stay where you are"
"be happy still"
"Your dusty cap"
"worth more than my golden crown"
"Your mill"
"than my kingdom"
"If"
"more such men"
"good place"
"world would be"
"Good-by"
king
walked sadly away
miller went back to his work singing
