A long time ago
lived
kind old poet
one evening
storm arose
but
poet sat warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner
"Let me in!"
"I am cold"
"I'm so wet"
exclaimed
a child that stood crying at the door
quite naked
water ran down
his long golden hair
trembled with cold
"Poor child!" said
poet
"Come in"
"I will soon restore thee"
"thou art"
"a charming child"
His eyes
like two bright stars
looked
like a little angel
little bow in his hand
arrows
into the other
poet seated
beside his hearth
took the little fellow on his lap
squeezed
water out of his
hair
warmed his hands
boiled
wine
boy recovered
he jumped down from the lap
danced round
said the old man
"What's your name?"
"Cupid"
answered the boy
"There lies my bow"
"weather is now clearing up"
"your bow is quite spoiled"
said
poet
"it is dry again"
"I will try it"
And he
shot an arrow at the
poet
laughing
away he ran
naughty boy
to shoot the
poet
who had treated him so kindly
poet lay on the earth
wept
arrow had
flown into his heart
"I will tell all children about him"
"not play with him"
"he will"
"cause them sorrow"
"heartache"
children to whom he related this story
took great heed
of
Cupid
but he made fools of them still
he is
cunning
When the university students come
he runs beside them
impossible for them to know him
unperceived
he thrusts an arrow to their bosom
he is forever following people
once he even shot your father and mother
you must never have anything to do with him
