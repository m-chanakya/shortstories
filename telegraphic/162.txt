I see
columns of the daily press
"Professor Plumb"
"invented"
"concentrated form of food"
"pellets"
"each"
"contains"
"one to two hundred times"
"nourishment as an ounce of"
"article of diet"
"diluted with water"
"will form all"
"necessary to support life"
professor looks forward
to revolutionizing
food system
but
it is going to have
drawbacks
we can
imagine
incidents as the following:
family
gathered round
table
Christmas dinner
father
lifted the thimble
disclosed
small pill of concentrated nourishment
agonized cry from the mother
"Baby has snatched the pill"
Gustavus Adolphus
grabbed
dinner
bolted it
"Clap him on the back!"
"Give him water!"
idea was fatal
water
caused it to expand
Adolphus exploded
when they gathered
corpse together
lingering smile
worn by a child who had eaten thirteen Christmas dinners
