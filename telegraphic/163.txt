"Why are you crying, Little Cat?" asked Little Dog
"Because my paws are so cold!" said Little Cat
"I have been digging in the snow and I cannot find one"
"One what?"
"One new leaf."
"What do you want of a new leaf?"
"to turn it over"
"but there"
"aren't any"
"Of course"
said Little Dog
"It is winter"
"But Little Girl is going to find one," said Little Cat
"her mother"
"said everybody had to turn over new leaves now"
"what do you suppose it means?"
Little Dog shook his head
"We must ask somebody"
"Great Old Dog is out for a walk"
"Crosspatch Parrot bit me the last time I asked her a question."
said Little Cat
"We will ask Old Cat in the Barn"
They found Old Cat
She listened to Little Cat's story
"How many rats have you caught this week?" asked Old Cat
to Little Dog
"None!"
"last rat"
"bit me"
"besides"
"they are odious, vulgar"
"Little Cat, how many mice have you caught in the kitchen this week?"
"I haven't caught any," she said
"don't care for mice"
"like cream better"
Old Cat
eyes shot out sparks
fur began to stand up
"you two"
"listen to me!"
"Big People"
"keep you because you are supposed to be useful"
"Your mother, Little Cat"
"was a hard-working"
"mouser"
"Your father, Little Dog"
"hunted rats with me in this barn"
"But since your parents died you"
"have done next to nothing"
"mice are all over the house"
"no creature"
"is worth his salt unless he earns it"
said Little Cat
"I am very sorry"
said Little Dog
"I am very sorry"
said Old Cat
"Then turn over a new leaf!"
said Little Cat and Little Dog together
"but we can't find any"
said Old Cat
"it is"
"foolish ways of speaking"
"Big People have"
"It just means"
"stop being bad"
"begin to be good"
said Little Cat
"now I see"
"I will go"
"catch a mouse this minute"
said Little Dog
"I see, too"
"I will come"
"hunt rats with you"
said Old Cat
"That is right!"
"Go to work, like good children"
"I may have been"
"short with you lately I will turn over a new leaf, too"
"ask you both to supper"
