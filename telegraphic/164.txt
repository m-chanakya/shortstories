I am losing my interest in human beings
significance of their lives
actions
Some one
said
better to study one man than ten books
I want neither books nor men
they make me suffer
Can one of them talk to me like
the Summer night?
night came slowly
as I lay
under the maple tree
creeping stealthily
thinking I did not notice
outlines of trees
blended in one black mass
only light
in the sky
filtering through
maple leaves
a star
night is solemn
means mystery
Human shapes flitted by
Some stole up
to peep at me
I did not mind
My whole being
abandoned to
soothing
charm of the night
katydids began their slumber song
wise they are
do not chatter like people
tell me only
"sleep, sleep, sleep"
wind rippled
maple leaves like
warm love thrills
A man came
with his "Bible Class"
Shall I ask
young fool
born yesterday
will die tomorrow
of Christ
would rather ask the stars
they have seen him
