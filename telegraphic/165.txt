not so much a day as a
furnace
We were eleven inside the omnibus
room for just one more
know my fellow-passengers
We were all failures in life
hope
nobody
claim the vacant seat
But at Charing Cross
got in -- a boy
bound for the docks
could tell
set foot
London
first time
more than one of us wanted to speak, but dared not
made us shudder to look on the young face
The woman with an incurable complaint
"Speak to him"
I was two hundred miles away
starting off to school
she went on
"only the young"
"I pity"
The matrimonial agent
rose
saw him slip a couple of half-crowns into the conductor's hand
jerking his head back
it was my turn to alight
forced up courage to
say
"Good luck, my boy."
