"to take that train"
said Colonel Levering
"you will have to remain"
"all night in Atlanta"
"I advise you not to put up at"
"Breathitt House"
"an old wooden building"
"urgent need of repairs"
"breaches in the walls"
"bedrooms have no locks"
"furniture"
"bedding"
"you must take your chance"
"being stowed in with a lot of others"
"a most abominable hotel"
"night"
"I passed in it"
"uncomfortable"
"got in late"
"shown to my room"
"by an apologetic night clerk"
"I was worn out by"
"hard railway travel"
"not entirely recovered from a gunshot wound in the head"
"Rather than look for better quarters I lay down"
"fell asleep"
"toward morning I awoke"
"moon had risen"
"illuminating the room"
"Imagine my surprise"
"when I saw"
"floor occupied by"
"dozen other lodgers"
"I sat up"
"about to"
"make trouble for the night clerk"
"when something"
"affected me"
"frozen with terror"
"For those men were"
"all dead!"
"At last"
"I escaped"
"ran to the office"
"night clerk"
"behind the desk"
"sitting in the dim light"
"just sitting and staring"
"He was a little chap"
"colorless face"
"blankest eyes"
"no"
"expression"
"clothing was a dirty gray"
"'Damn you!' I said"
"night clerk rose"
"bowed"
"and--"
"was no longer there"
"at that moment"
"hand laid upon my shoulder from behind"
"frightened, I turned"
"saw"
"gentleman"
"who asked"
"What is the matter, my friend?"
"I was not long in telling him"
"he went pale himself"
"This is not a hotel"
"used to be"
"afterward it was a hospital"
"Now it is unoccupied"
"room"
"you mention was the dead room"
"fellow that you call the night clerk used to be that"
"I don't understand his being here"
"He has been dead a few weeks"
"who are you?"
"I blurted"
"I look after the premises"
"happened to be passing"
"seeing a light"
"came in to investigate"
"Let us have a look into that room"
"I'll see you at the devil first"
"said I"
"bolting out of the door"
