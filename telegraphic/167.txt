The Owl
sleep during the day
after sundown
begins her hunt
a certain old Owl
become very cross
if anything disturbed her
slumbers
One
afternoon
she dozed
in her den
Grasshopper nearby began a
song
Out popped
Owl
"Get away from here"
she said
"leave me to sleep in quiet"
But
Grasshopper answered
that he had as much right to his place
as the Owl had to her place
he struck up a louder
tune
wise
Owl knew
it would do no good to argue
Besides
her eyes were not sharp enough by day
to punish the Grasshopper
So she
spoke very kindly
"if I must stay awake"
"I am going"
"to enjoy your singing"
"I have a wonderful wine here"
"from Olympus"
"which"
"will make you sing like Apollo"
foolish Grasshopper was taken in by
flattering words
jumped to the Owl's den
as soon as he was near enough
Owl
pounced
ate him
