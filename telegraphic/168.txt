WHEN
cat first found
nest
there was nothing in it
it was
just finished
she said, "I will wait!"
waited a week
climbed up
the tree
peeped into the nest
There lay two
eggs
cat said
"Eggs may be good"
"young birds"
"better"
she waited
another week
passed
climbed the tree again
peeped into the nest
there were five eggs
she waited a little longer
went up again to look
there were five tiny birds
But
they were very thin
she said
"Thin birds may be good"
"fat birds"
"better"
she waited
she watched
father-bird bringing worms all day
and said
"they must be fattening"
At last
one day she thought
"they must be fat enough"
when she reached the top
looked into the nest
it was empty
cat sat down
spoke
"those birds are the horridest"
"meanest"
"most ungrateful"
