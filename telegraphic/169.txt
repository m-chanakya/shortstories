THERE was once a child who was untidy
One day the Tidy Angel came into his nursery
"go out"
"stay with your brother while I set things to rights here"
"I have no brother!" said the child
"You may not know him, but he will know you"
he went
into the garden and waited
a squirrel came along
"Are you my brother?" asked the child
"I should hope not!" he said
"Why do you insult me"
He whisked off
a wren came
"Are you my brother?" asked the child
"No indeed!" said the wren. "What impertinence!"
He hopped off
Tommy Cat came along
"Are you my brother?" asked the child
"Go and look at yourself in the glass," said the Tommy Cat
"no such creatures as you in my family"
He walked on
a pig came
child did not wish to ask the pig
but the pig did not wait
"Hallo, brother!" he grunted
"I am not your brother!" said the child
"yes, you are!" said the pig
"Come along"
"roll in the barnyard"
"I don't like to roll in mud!" said the child
he began to cry
Tidy Angel came out
"I have set everything to rights," she said
"will you go with the Pig Brother, or "
"come back with me"
"be a tidy child?"
"With you"
cried the child
