"Now that corpse"
[said the undertaker]
"was so"
"accommodating"
"in his last moments"
"Friends wanted metallic burial case"
"I couldn't get it"
"Corpse said"
"shake him up"
"a box"
"comfortable"
"Friends wanted a silver door-plate on the coffin"
"a fellow couldn't roust out such a"
"thing"
"Corpse said, whitewash his old canoe"
"dob his address"
"onto it"
"with a verse from some"
"hymn"
"preparations was bound to delay"
"he didn't wish to be kept layin' round"
"so carm and so cool"
"the relations"
"wanted a big funeral"
"but corpse"
"didn't want any procession"
"he had a minister"
"read his funeral sermon"
"he made them trot out the choir"
"help them pick out the tunes"
"he just laid there"
"happy"
"tried to join in"
"he opened his mouth"
"I never see a man snuffed out so sudden"
"I hain't got time to be palavering"
"if you'll just give me a lift we'll skeet him into the hearse"
"Relations"
"pay no attention to dying injunctions"
"but"
"whatever a corpse trusts me to do I'm a-going to do"
He
went
away with his
hearse
I continued my walk
learned
cheerfulness is not
impossible to any occupation
