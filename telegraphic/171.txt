ONCE upon a time
a prince
wanted to marry
a real princess
He travelled
the world
nowhere could he get what he wanted
he came home
was sad
One evening
terrible storm came
Suddenly
knocking
at the city gate
king went to open
It was a princess
what a sight the rain and
wind
made her look
yet she said
she was a real princess
we'll soon find that out
thought the old queen
she
went into the bedroom
took
bedding off
laid a pea
took twenty mattresses
laid them on the pea
then twenty eiderdown beds on top of the mattresses
On this the princess had to lie
In the morning she was asked how she had slept
very badly! said she
Now they knew
she was a real princess because she had felt the pea
Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive
prince took her for his wife
