little stone Saint occupied
side aisle of the old cathedral
No one quite remembered who he had been
Goblin
fine specimen of quaint stone carving
lived up
the wall opposite
Saint
Saint and the Goblin got on very well
though they looked at most things from different points of view
Saint
philanthropist
thought the world
was good
might be improved
he pitied the church mice
who were
poor
Goblin
was of opinion
world
better be let alone
It was the function of the church mice to be poor
"All the same," said the Saint
"I feel"
"sorry for them"
"Of course"
said the Goblin
"it's YOUR function to feel sorry"
Goblin might be right
but still
he would like to do something for
mice before winter
Whilst he was thinking
he was startled by
a hard metallic clatter
It was a
thaler
one of the cathedral jackdaws
had flown in with it
banging of the sacristy door
startled him into dropping it
"What have you got there?" asked the Goblin
"thaler," said the Saint
"now I can do something for the church mice"
"How"
asked the Goblin
"I will appear in a vision to the vergeress"
"tell her"
"she will find a silver thaler between my feet"
"she must take it"
"buy a measure of corn"
"put it on my shrine"
"When she finds the money she will know"
"it was a true dream"
"follow my directions"
"mice will have food"
Saint began to reflect
such an opportunity was too rare
Perhaps indiscriminate charity
harmful to the church mice
After all
it was their function to be poor
Goblin was generally right
"perhaps"
"better if I ordered"
"candles"
"instead of the corn"
He often wished
people would sometimes burn candles at his shrine
as they had forgotten who he was
"more orthodox," said the Goblin
"mice could have the ends to eat"
"candle-ends are"
"fattening"
Goblin was too well bred to wink
"Well, if it ain't there, sure enough!" said the vergeress next morning
She took the
coin
did an unaccountable thing
hung it round the neck of the little Saint
went away
"only possible explanation," said the Goblin, "is that it's a bad one"
"What is that decoration your neighbour is wearing?"
"a coin of"
"fabulous value," replied the Goblin tactfully
news went round the Cathedral
shrine of
Saint
enriched by a priceless offering
"it's something to have the conscience of a goblin," said the Saint
mice were as poor as ever
that was their function
