(said)
(Mr. K)
law
strict against
"games of chance"
boys
detected playing "seven up" or "old sledge" for money
Sturgis
retained to defend them
he must lose a case at last
idea flashed upon Sturgis
the plea that old sledge was not a game of chance
judge smiled with the rest
opposite counsel tried to ridicule him
did not succeed
judge
said the joke had gone far enough
Jim Sturgis said
his clients could not be punished
until it was proven
game of chance
Judge and counsel
called Deacons
and Dominies
to testify
they unanimously
pronouncing that old sledge was a game of chance
"a game of science!" retorted Sturgis
brought in
witnesses
judge
said
no way of coming to a determination
just as many
testify on one side as
on the other
would act upon any suggestion Mr. Sturgis would make
"a jury of six of each, Luck versus Science"
four deacons
two dominies
as the "chance" jurymen
six
seven-up professors
represent the "science" side
VERDICT:
jury
unanimously decide
seven-up is
a game of science
"chance" men never won
all busted
"science" men have got the money
"seven-up came to be set apart"
"as being a game not of chance but of science"
"not punishable under the law," said Mr. K
