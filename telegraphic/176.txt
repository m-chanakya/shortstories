"be good children"
Said Mrs. Lee
"While I am away"
"dont get into mischief"
Mr. & Mrs. Lee were going off
leave The Two children John 10 yrs old & Alice 2 yrs old
As Soon as The Elder Lees were away
younger Lees went down cellar
Alice leaned against the wall
bricks behind her crumbled away he
Lifted her out
there was a passage he said
"lets come & see what this is"
John
got 2 candles
went back to the cellar passage
nothing was visible but a box
they examined it
contain nothing
walked on farther
they were in a cave
alice was frightened
but at her brothers assurance
allayed her fears
they came to a small box which John took up
carried within
they came on a boat
he dragged it
along with him
they found the passage came to an abrupt stop he pulled the obstacle away
water rushed in
John was an expert swimmer
he tried to rise but with the box & his sister he found it
impossible
he caught sight of the boat
grasped it
he was on the surface
if the water continued rising it would rise to the top
he could shut off the water he
did this
lifting the now lifeless body of his sister into the boat
sailed down the passage
his own cellar
rushed up stairs with the body
to find his parents
told them the story
funeral of alice occupied so much time
John
forgot about the box
when they did open it they found
solid gold chunk worth
$10,000 enough to pay for any thing but the death of his sister
