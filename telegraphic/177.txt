king of England
William the Conqueror
had three sons
One day
William
thinking of something
made him
sad
wise men
asked him what was the matter
"what my sons may do after I am dead"
"which one of the three ought to be the king when I am gone"
said the wise men
"if we"
"knew what things your sons admire"
"we might"
"tell what kind of men they will be"
"Perhaps"
"asking each one"
"a few questions"
"we can find out which one"
"best fitted to rule"
said the king
"ask them what you please"
wise men
agreed that the young princes should be brought in
one at a time
same questions
put to each
first who came
was Robert
tall, willful lad
nicknamed Short Stocking
said one of the men
"answer me this"
"If, instead of being a boy"
"you should be a bird"
"what kind of a bird would you rather be?"
"A hawk"
"for no other bird reminds one"
"of a bold and gallant knight"
next
was young William
jolly and round
red hair
nicknamed Rufus
"An eagle"
"because it is strong and brave"
"feared by all"
"therefore the king of them all"
Lastly came
Henry
with quiet steps
sober, thoughtful look
taught to read and write
nicknamed Beau-clerc
Handsome Scholar
"A starling"
"because it is good-mannered and kind"
"never tries to rob or abuse its neighbor"
Then the wise men
spoke to the king
"Robert, will be bold and gallant"
"do some great deeds"
"make a name"
"but"
"will be overcome by his foes"
"die in prison"
"William, will be"
"brave and strong"
"feared and hated for his cruel deeds"
"lead a wicked life"
"die a shameful death"
"Henry, will be wise and prudent and peaceful"
"will go to war only when"
"forced"
"loved at home"
"respected abroad"
"die in peace after having gained great possessions"
Years passed by
