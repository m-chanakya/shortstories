Cincinnatus
lived on a little farm not far from
Rome
He had once been rich
held the highest office
but
lost all his wealth
now so poor
he had to
work on his farm
Cincinnatus was so wise
everybody trusted him
asked his advice
among the mountains
a tribe of fierce, half-wild men
war with the Roman
They persuaded
another tribe
to help
then marched toward
city
plundering and robbing
At first
Romans
proud and brave
did not think there was much danger
army
to fight the robbers
finest in the world
No one staid
home with the women and children
but the
"Fathers"
who made the laws
and a small company of men who guarded the walls
one morning five horsemen came
men and horses were covered with dust and blood
they reached
where the white-haired Fathers were sitting
told their story
"yesterday"
"our army was marching through a narrow valley"
"All at once a thousand savage men sprang out"
"blocked up the way"
"pass was so narrow"
"we could not fight"
"tried to come back"
"blocked up"
"this side of us too"
"caught in a trap"
"ten of us set spurs to our horses"
"five of us forced our way through"
"other five fell"
"send help to our army"
"or every man will be slain"
"city will be taken"
said
Fathers
"Whom can we send but the guards and the boys?"
"who is wise enough to lead them"
it seemed as if there was no hope
Then one said
"Send for Cincinnatus"
"He will help us"
Cincinnatus was in the field
when the men who had been sent to him came
He stopped and greeted them kindly
"Is all well with Rome?"
they said
"The people of Rome make you their ruler"
"to do with everything as you choose"
"Fathers bid you come at once"
"go out against our enemies"
Cincinnatus
hurried to the city
he armed the guards and the boys
went out at their head to fight
A few days afterward
men of the mountains had been beaten
driven back
Roman army
boys
guards
coming home
at their head rode Cincinnatus
He had saved Rome
Cincinnatus might
have made himself king
But
he gave back the power to
Fathers
went again to his little farm
He had been
ruler of Rome for sixteen days
