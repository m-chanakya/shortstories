people of Switzerland
not always free
happy
Many years ago
tyrant
Gessler
ruled
One day
tyrant set up a tall pole in the public square
put his
cap on the top
gave orders
every man who came into the town should bow
before it
But
William Tell
would not do this
laughed at
cap
would not bow
to Gessler himself
Gessler heard of this
was very angry
afraid
other men would disobey
whole country would rebel
he made up his mind to punish
William Tell
was a famous hunter
Gessler knew this
thought of a cruel plan
ordered that Tell's little boy
stand
in the public square with an apple on his head
bade Tell shoot the apple
Tell begged the tyrant
"You must hit the apple with"
"one arrow"
"If you fail"
"my soldiers shall kill the boy"
Tell
took aim
let it fly
boy stood firm
not afraid
he had
faith in his father's skill
It struck the apple
people
shouted with joy
an arrow
hidden under his coat dropped
cried Gessler
"what mean you with this second arrow?"
"this arrow was for your heart if I had hurt my child"
there is an old story
that
not long after
Tell did shoot the tyrant
thus
set his country free
