was once
king
name
Dionysius. He
unjust and cruel
tyrant
everybody hated him
he
always
in dread
some one
take his life
he
very rich
he lived in
fine palace
many
beautiful
costly things
he
waited upon by
host of servants
One day
friend of his
Damocles, said
"How happy you"
"have"
"everything"
"any man could wish"
"change places with me," said
tyrant
"No"
said Damocles
"but"
"if I could"
"for one day"
"Very well," said
tyrant
next day, Damocles
led into
palace
the servants
bidden to treat
as their master
He sat down
in
banquet hall
rich foods
placed before him
flowers
perfumes
music
He rested
among soft cushions
felt
he was
happiest man in
world
he
raise his eyes toward
ceiling
What was
dangling above him
point almost touching his head
a sharp sword
hung by
single horse-hair
if
hair
break?
smile faded
of Damocles
hands trembled
He longed to be out of the palace
"What is the matter?" said
tyrant
"That sword!"
cried Damocles
badly frightened
"Yes," said Dionysius
"sword above your head"
"may fall at any moment"
"why"
"trouble you? I have"
"all the time"
"every moment in dread"
"Let me go," said Damocles
"I was mistaken"
"rich and powerful are not so happy"
he never again wanted to be rich, or
change places
with the king
