ONCE upon a time
four little Rabbits
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter
lived with their Mother
underneath
root of a
fir tree
said
Mrs. Rabbit one morning
"you may go into the fields or down the lane"
"don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden"
"Father had an accident there"
"was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor"
"run along"
"I am going out"
FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail
were good
went down the lane to gather blackberries
BUT Peter
was
naughty
ran straight
to Mr. McGregor's garden
squeezed under the gate
ate some lettuces
French beans
radishes
feeling
sick
went to look for
parsley
BUT
he meet but Mr. McGregor!
he jumped
ran after Peter
waving a rake
PETER
frightened
rushed all over the garden
forgotten the way back
lost one of his shoes among the cabbages
other
amongst the potatoes
he ran on four legs
went faster
might have got away
unfortunately
run into a gooseberry net
got caught by the
buttons on his jacket
PETER
shed
tears
sobs were overheard by
friendly sparrows
who
implored him to exert himself
McGREGOR came
with a sieve
but Peter wriggled out
in time
leaving his jacket behind
rushed into the toolshed
jumped into a can
would have been
beautiful thing to hide in
if it had not
so much water
McGREGOR was quite sure
Peter was somewhere in the toolshed
Peter sneezed
McGregor was after him
who jumped out of a window
window was too small for Mr. McGregor
he was tired
went back to his work
PETER sat down to rest
he began to wander about
found a door in a wall
it was locked
no room
to squeeze underneath
mouse was running in and out
carrying peas
Peter asked her the way
she had
a large pea in her mouth
could not answer
shook her head
Peter began to cry
he tried
his way straight across the garden
came to a pond
A white cat was staring at some gold fish
Peter thought
best to go away without speaking to her
HE went back towards
toolshed
heard
noise
scuttered underneath the bushes
nothing happened
he came out
climbed
a wheelbarrow
peeped
he saw
McGregor hoeing onions
beyond him was the gate
PETER got down
quietly
started running
McGregor caught sight of him
but Peter did not care
He slipped underneath the gate
was safe at last
never stopped running
till he got home
He was so tired
mother was busy cooking
wondered what he had done with his clothes
second
jacket
shoes
Peter
lost in a fortnight
Peter
not
well during the evening
mother put him to bed
made
camomile tea
gave a dose of it to Peter
Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread
milk
blackberries
for supper
