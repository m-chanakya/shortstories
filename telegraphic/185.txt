The Guest
had lived in the house for years
he had become
like a member of the family
he had earned his living
being industrious
useful
children had a liking for him because he sang
and told
fairy-tales
So he was
surprised
aggrieved when the Master of the house said
"I suspect you"
"Of caring more for the house"
"you came from than"
"house that you live in"
"But"
"I was at home there once"
said the Guest
said the Master
"house in which you lived formerly is become our enemy"
"They threaten us tonight"
"where you stand"
Guest
was very sentimental
"I am with you"
he said
"Good"
said the Master
"let us make the house"
they closed
shutters
locked
front door
bade each other good night
But as the Guest went along his
corridor
Master
followed him very softly
Outside the house
there was a sound of many
voices
Guest came to the side door
moved the bolt
In the window
set his candle
house was ready for late-comers
Guest sighed
"my old friends"
"I am not responsible for what they do"
"Only I must my old affection prove"
he turned
Master
took him by the throat
"Traitor!" he cried
he choked
Guest to death
he shot the bolt
barred the window
called the servants
to defend the house
robbers were driven off
Guest was buried
