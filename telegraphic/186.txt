Once upon a time
there dwelt at Jerusalem two brothers
Athanasius
John
on a hill
lived upon what people gave
Every day
went out to work
for the poor
taking no payment
brothers went about separately the whole week
met
in the evening of the Sabbath
on Sunday
they remain at home
praying
Thus did the brothers live for many years
every week
Angel of the Lord
blessed them
One Monday
when the brothers
had parted
Athanasius
felt sorry
to part from his beloved brother
he
glanced after him
John was walking with bent head
suddenly
he perceived something
gaze fixedly at it
he drew near
suddenly leaped aside
ran towards the mountain
away from the place
Athanasius was astonished
he approached the spot
on the grass
lay a heap of gold
"What was he afraid of"
thought Athanasius
"You may do ill with gold, but you may also do good"
Athanasius
brought in all the gold
went to the merchants
bought land in that town
set about building three houses
one of the houses was an asylum for widows and orphans
second house was a hospital
third house was a hospice
Athanasius sought
out three God-fearing elders
Athanasius had three thousand gold pieces
left
he gave a thousand to each
to distribute among the poor
houses began to be filled
people began to praise Athanasius
Athanasius rejoiced thereat
he had no desire to depart
But Athanasius loved his brother
not keeping for himself a single coin
he went back to his dwelling
Athanasius was drawing near to his mountain
he beheld standing in his path the Angel
now looked threateningly upon him
Angel opened his mouth
"Depart"
"Thou art not worthy to dwell with thy brother"
"one leap aside of thy brother's was worth more than"
"that thou hast done with thy gold"
"Devil"
"placed the gold there in order to corrupt thee"
conscience of Athanasius upbraided him
he understood
what he had done was not
for God
he wept
began to repent
Angel stepped aside
John was
awaiting his brother
from thenceforth Athanasius yielded no more to the wiles of the Devil
he understood that not by gold
but by good works only
he render service to God and his fellow-man
brethren dwelt together as before
