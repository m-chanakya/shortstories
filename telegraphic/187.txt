Among the soldiers of King Philip
was a poor man who had done some brave deeds
pleased the king
One day this soldier
at sea when
storm came up
ship
was wrecked
soldier
cast
upon the shore
would have died
had it not been for
kind care of a farmer
When
soldier was well
he thanked the farmer
promised
he would repay him
But he did not mean to keep
promise
He did not tell King
about the man
He only said
there was a
farm by
seashore
he would like
to have it for his own
"Who owns the farm"
asked Philip
"a churlish farmer"
said the soldier
"Very well"
said Philip
"take the farm"
soldier made haste to drive
farmer from his house
took the farm
poor farmer
went
to
king
told
whole story
Philip was
angry
He sent for the soldier
burned in his forehead
"THE UNGRATEFUL GUEST"
Thus
world was made to know of the mean act
until he died all men
hated him
