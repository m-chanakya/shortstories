Sherwood forest
there lived a band of
men called out-laws
they spent their time
roaming
hunting
robbing rich travelers
their leader was
Robin Hood
Whenever they had taken anything
Robin Hood
divided it fairly
never allowed
harm anybody but the rich
kind to the poor
Robin Hood
standing one day
by the roadside
saw a young man
he seemed to be
happy
"I think he is on his way to his wedding"
next day
Robin
saw the same young man
did not seem to be so happy
Robin Hood stepped out
"Have you any money to spare"
"nothing"
said the young man
"but five shillings and a ring"
said Robin: "it is a wedding ring."
"I have kept it to give to my bride on our wedding day"
"going to be married yesterday"
"But her father has promised her to a rich old man"
"your name?" asked Robin
"Allin-a-Dale"
"she is to be married this very day"
"church is five miles away"
Robin made haste to dress
as a harper
stood in the door of the church
"glad you have come"
said the bishop
"Come in, and play"
"not"
"until I see the bride and bridegroom"
old man came in
By his side walked a fair young girl
"This is no match," said Robin
put his horn to his lips
blew three times
four and twenty men
marched into the church
foremost among them was Allin-a-Dale
"whom do you choose?" said Robin
"Allin-a-Dale"
she said
the fair maiden and Allin-a-Dale were married then and there
