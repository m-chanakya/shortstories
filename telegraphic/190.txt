once upon a time a wicked prince
set upon conquering all the countries
he devastated
countries
his soldiers trod down the crops
destroyed the peasants' huts
Many a poor mother fled
baby in her arms
soldiers followed her
when they found her
she served
to their diabolical enjoyments
prince was of opinion
all this was right
His power increased day by day
his name was feared by all
fortune favoured his deeds
He brought enormous wealth home
erected
splendid buildings
looked with delight upon his gold
his magnificent edifices
thought
"I must have more"
He made war with all his neighbours
conquered kings were chained up
to his chariot
had to kneel
live on the morsels which they left
prince had his
statue erected
public places
he even wished it to be placed in the churches
priests opposed
saying
"Prince, you are mighty"
"but God's power is much greater than yours"
said the prince
"Then I will conquer God too"
he ordered
ship to be constructed
which he could sail through the air
it was covered with thousands of eyes
each eye was
a gun
Hundreds of eagles were attached
it rose
towards the sun
earth was soon left far below
God sent one of his
angels against the ship
prince showered thousands of bullets upon him
they rebounded
One drop of blood
came out of
angel's wings
fell upon the ship
burnt into it
weighed upon
thousands of hundredweights
dragging it rapidly down
eagles gave way
prince was lying half-dead
when it sank
into the branches of a large tree
"I will conquer God!" said the prince
"I have sworn it"
he spent seven years
construction of
ships to sail through the air
darts cast from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven
gathered warriors from all countries
placed side by side they covered
several miles
They entered the ships
prince was approaching his own
when God sent
one swarm of little gnats
They buzzed
stung his face and hands
he drew his sword
but he only touched the air
he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings
wrap him in them
but one single gnat
crept into the prince's ear
stung him
The place burnt
poison entered
his blood
Mad with pain
he tore off the coverings
his clothes
danced about before
his soldiers
who now mocked at him
mad prince
wished to make war with God
overcome by a single little gnat
