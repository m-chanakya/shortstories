"if you want to," replied
Dog. "Leave"
"woods"
"Follow my example"
"What must I do?" asked the Wolf.
"Hardly anything," answered
House Dog. "Chase"
"bark"
"fawn on the people of"
"house"
"return you"
"get tidbits"
"every kind"
"kind words and caresses."
The Wolf had

"What"
"on your neck?"
"Nothing at all," replied
Dog.
"tell me."
"collar to which my chain is fastened."
"What!"
cried
Wolf. "Don't you go wherever you please?"
"Not always!"
replied
Dog.
"I wouldn't take all"
"tender young lambs"
"at that price."
away ran the Wolf
nothing worth
much as liberty.
