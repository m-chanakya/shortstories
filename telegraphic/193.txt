said Peter
they beat
their sticks on the ground as though there had been a hundred sheep
another man of Gotham came from
market with a sack of meal
He heard
neighbors quarreling about sheep
he
see no sheep between them
"you foolish fellows!" he cried.
"Come here"
the man carried his meal to
side of
bridge
"look at me," he said, "and learn a lesson."
he opened the
sack
poured all the meal into the river.
he said
"tell how much meal is in my sack?"
"none at all!" cried Hodge and Peter
"You are right," said the man
"you"
"stand here and quarrel about nothing"
"no more sense in your heads than I have meal in my sack!"
