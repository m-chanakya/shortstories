Tommy was
near the end of the lane
The girls from the big house came
stood
in front of him, staring
rudely
"are you tired?" they asked.
"Yes," Tommy answered
"very tired"
"father's working"
"got to take him his dinner"
"Why don't"
"servants"
Tommy scornfully;
"no servants"
"not rich people"
"like to be rich?" the eldest sister asked
"too expensive," said Tommy
"rich people have to buy"
"lot of things"
"wear fine clothes"
"can't have dinner in the fields."
"My father"
"dinner in a room," said the girl.
"because he's rich," answered Tommy
"people"
"talk if he didn't; rich people can't do as they like, as poor can."
"father lives in
big house," the girl went on
"takes up a lot of room; my father's got"
"whole world to live in"
"better than"
"house."
"father doesn't work," said the girl
"Mine does," said Tommy, proudly. "Rich people can't"
"get the poor folk to do it"
"we"
"made everything"
"fine thing to be poor."
"suppose all the poor folk died," cried Tommy, "what"
"rich folk do?"
"carriages"
"can't build"
"eat dinners"
"can't cook"
went his way. "Poor folk ought"
"be"
"kind"
"rich folk, for it's hard to be"
"them," he said to himself
