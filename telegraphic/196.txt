I drove all night
till I reached Neempani
place was
familiar to me
First time I came here was with Sonal
our first date
arranged by our parents
she liked long drives
So we took the highway
We talked without
agenda
moonlit night
trees arching the roads
the night was
surreal
It was her idea to dine at Neempani
She said
food here was good
she was right
We got married
shifted to Bhopal
Everything was
perfect
With the passing time
our marriage withered out
we fought
One
day we decided
we part our ways
Yesterday we got divorced
Tonight as I waited for my order
I wondered
Both the nights
so different yet so similar
Both
changed
my life
That night
budding bonding between us
tonight
the end of the bitter
marriage
