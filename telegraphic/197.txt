training
for the Buckatowndown races
old grey warrior
known
as The Trickler
managed to get the old horse pretty fit
When the horses
galloping
the kangaroo-dog, Victor
run round with them
someone said
tie up Victor or
getting stolen at the races
called
but he had made himself scarce
forgot
about him
Buckatowndown Races
horses strung across to the start at the far side
down went the flag
they came sweeping along
All of a sudden
Victor
running right in front of the field
looked
some
would fall on him
The owners
swore
As the field came past the stand
could hear the riders swearing
pace became very merry
dog stretched out
cut off corners
joined at odd intervals
then The Trickler and the publican's mare singled out
she swerved off while he struggled home a winner
as they settled down to finish Victor dashed
passed the post at
Trickler's girths
the judge placed Trickler first, Victor second
publican tried to argue
judge said it was HIS (hiccough) business
Fifteen protests were lodged
didn't worry
we had laid the stewards a bit to nothing
stole away
remains on the annals
how a kangaroo-dog ran second
