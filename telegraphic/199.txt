legend
among
South American Indians.
God
made men so that they
no need to work
lived till they were a hundred
did not know what illness was.
after
time, God
see how people
living
instead of being happy
they
quarrelled with one another
each caring for himself
far from enjoying life, they cursed it.
God said
"comes of their living separately"
to change this
God
arranged matters that
became impossible for people to live without working. To avoid suffering
now obliged to build dwellings
grow and gather fruits and grain.
"Work will bring them together," thought God. "They cannot"
"each one alone by himself."
"they work together, the more they will have"
"the better they"
"live"
"will unite them."
again God
see how men were living
found
worse than before. They worked together
but not all together
broken up into
groups
each
tried to snatch
from other
hindered one another
so that things went ill with them all.
God decided
that man
might die at any moment; and he announced
"may die at any moment," thought God, "they will not"
"spoil the hours of life allotted to them."
When God returned
saw
bad as ever.
Those who were strongest
subdued those who were weaker
the strongest and their descendants
suffered from the weariness of idleness
those
weaker
suffered from lack of rest. Each set of men
hated the other
life of man became
more unhappy.
God
decided to
sent
sickness among men
they would understand
those who are well should have pity on those who are sick, and
help them, that when they themselves fall ill those who are well might in turn help them.
God went away
when He came back
he saw
worse even than before
sickness
divided them more
Those men who were strong enough to make others work, forced them also to wait on them in times of sickness; but they did not, in their turn, look after others who were ill.
those who
work for others
no time to look after their own sick
houses were arranged in which these poor people suffered and died, far from those whose sympathy might have cheered them, and in the arms of hired people who nursed them without compassion
even with disgust
people
fearing to catch them
avoided the sick
God said
"let them be taught by suffering."
left men to themselves.
left to themselves, men lived long before they understood that they all ought to, and might be, happy.
