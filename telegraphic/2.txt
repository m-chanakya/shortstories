PEPLOV and his wife Kleopatra Petrovna
standing at the door
On the other side
a love scene
between
their daughter Natashenka and a teacher
called Shchupkin
whispered Peplov
"as soon as they begin talking of their feelings"
"take down the ikon"
"we'll go in and bless them"
"sacred and binding"
On the other side
said Shchupkin
"I never wrote you any letters!"
"As though I didn't know your writing!" giggled the girl
"How can you teach writing if you write so badly yourself?"
"The great thing"
"is not the hand one writes, but keeping the boys in order."
"Nekrassov was an author, but his handwriting's a disgrace"
"I should love to marry an author"
"I can write you a poem, too"
"if I write you a real poem, will you let me kiss your hand?"
"You can kiss it now if you like"
"Take down the ikon," Peplov whispered
Peplov flung open the door
he muttered
"Lord bless you, my children"
the mamma
said to Shchupkin
""Love my girl, be good to her"
Shchupkin's mouth fell open
he thought
"There's no escape!"
he bowed his head submissively
the papa went on
shed tears
"Kleopatra, give me the ikon"
the father suddenly left off weeping
he said angrily
"Is that the ikon?"
the mamma had snatched
portrait of Lazhetchnikov
in mistake for the ikon
Old Peplov and his wife stood
not knowing what to do
The writing master
slipped away
