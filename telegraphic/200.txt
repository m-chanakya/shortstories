The Grafin's two elder sons
made deplorable marriages
a family habit. The youngest boy, Wratislav,
black sheep of
family
no marriage at all.
"viciousness," said the Grafin
"keeps boys out of mischief."
"Does it?" asked the Baroness Sophie
with
effort to talk intelligently
"don't know why I shouldn't talk cleverly," she
complain; "my mother"
"brilliant conversationalist."
"These things"
"skipping one generation," said the Grafin.
"so unjust," said Sophie
"I"
"should be"
"annoyed if my daughters talked brilliantly."
"none of them do," said the Grafin
"don't know about that," said the Baroness
in defence of her offspring. "Elsa said something"
"clever on Thursday"
"not every one who could say that."
"Every one has said it;"
"don't think"
"you're"
"agreeable today."
"never am"
"women with"
"perfect profile like mine are seldom"
"agreeable"
"don't think your profile is"
"perfect"
said the Baroness.
"surprising if it wasn't. My mother"
"beauties of her day."
"These things"
"skip a generation"
put in the Baroness
"Sophie," said the Grafin sweetly, "that isn't"
"clever"
"Elsa would do"
"well for Wratislav? It's time he married somebody"
"Elsa marry that"
"boy!" gasped the Baroness.
"Beggars can't be choosers," observed the Grafin.
"Elsa isn't"
"beggar!"
"Not financially"
"no pretensions to brains or looks or anything of that sort."
"she's my daughter."
"shows my generosity"
"what there"
"against Wratislav"
"no debts"
"his reputation! If"
"things"
"are true"
"Probably"
"are"
"You don't want"
"archangel"
"son-in-law."
"Elsa"
"miserable"
"if she couldn't get on with Wratislav she could"
"do good among the poor."
The Baroness picked up
photograph
"He"
"handsome," she said
"Elsa might reform him."
The Grafin had
presence of mind to laugh in
right key.
Three weeks later
"left the"
"children at the Rodenstahls'"
Grafin's greeting.
"they"
"happy?" asked the Baroness.
"they seem"
"wrapped up in each other?"
"Elsa looked"
"wrapped up in a horse-rug"
"you're lunching with me"
"Thursday."
The Baroness
late for her luncheon
Thursday.
she
burst into
room.
"Elsa has run away with the Rodenstahls' chauffeur!"
"now she can't marry Wratislav."
"She couldn't in any case," said the Griffin; "he left"
"for abroad last night."
"Why"
"Conscience makes cowboys of us all"
"didn't know Wratislav had"
"conscience."
"he hasn't"
"other people's consciences that send one abroad in a hurry. Let's"
"eat."
