Four men once came
forest to fish
pitched their tent
upon
ridge
little man volunteered
hold the camp
while the remaining three
go
for supplies
"There's only one of you -- the devil make a twin"
When it came night
The little man
heard the approach of the unknown
a bear paced into the light of the fire
He cried out and then darted around the campfire
Twice around they went
the little man flew into the tent
The bear
ventured in
The little man
rustled
under the flap
now without the tent
felt a
paw grab his coat
wriggled out of his coat
The bear
jerked the coat into the tent
began to play
with it
yells came to
little man
crying in a treetop
he saw the
tent quiver and fall
The bear's
play had disturbed the center pole
The tent began to flounder
to the edge of the mountain
three men
saw their tent approaching
dropped their bundles
scurried to one side
Below
it struck the base of a
tree
The three
started
for the top of the hill
The little man
calmly smoking
overwhelmed him with interrogations
"There's only one of me -- and the devil made a twin"
