THREE of Madame's
turkeys were missing
It was nearing Christmas
Monsieur grew agitated
all the household forces
search for the missing gobblers
Alice
the housemaid
went down the river
Polisson
the yard-boy
went up the bayou
Others crossed
fields
Artemise
vaguely instructed to "go look too"
Artemise is
extraordinary
age
between ten and fifteen
head
shape
chocolate-colored Easter-egg
talks
in monosyllables
gaze of an Egyptian sphinx
morning after my arrival at the plantation
awakened by
Artemise
"Is it cold out?" I asked
"Ya, 'm."
"Where do you sleep"
I further inquired
"In uh hole"
she meant
the hall
another time
she came with
wood
deposited it upon the hearth
stare fixedly at me
with folded hands
"Madame send you to build a fire"
I
ask
uncomfortable under the look
"Ya, 'm."
"Very well; make it"
"Matches!" was all she said
no matches in my room
she
considered
all personal responsibility ceased in face of this
Pages might be told of her unfathomable ways
but to the turkey hunt
All afternoon
searching party
brought unfavorable reports
Artemise
absent
an hour
glided into the hall
stood with crossed hands
she possibly had information
"you found the turkeys"
Madame
ask
"Ya, 'm."
shouted Aunt Florindy, the cook
"She 's a-lyin'"
"Warn't you stan'in'"
"back o' de hen-'ous'"
"Never budged a inch"
Artemise was
gazing at Aunt Florindy with unruffled calm
"Let her alone"
Madame interfered
"Where are the turkeys, Artemise?"
"Yon'a,"
"Where 'yonder'?" Madame demanded
impatiently
"In uh hen-'ous'!"
Sure enough
turkeys
accidentally locked up
when the chickens were fed
Artemise
hidden
during the search behind the hen-house
heard their
gobble
