Mr. William Holt
of Chicago
was living temporarily in
New York
had had "trouble with his wife,"
he had parted a year before
One evening
he had left the house of a brother
for a stroll
his mind was occupied
he had passed
beyond the town limits
he was "lost."
Realizing his mischance
He turned about
Before he had gone far he observed
the landscape
was brightening
He stopped
faced about
seeking the source of the
light
The light still came from behind him
Again he turned
always the light behind
Holt was astonished
he took out his watch
hands indicated
eleven o'clock and twenty-five minutes
At that moment
illumination suddenly flared
he saw near him
in the air
the figure of his wife
holding
the figure of his child
nothing was seen below the waist
gradually
environment became again visible
In the dawn
Holt found himself entering the village
He
arrived at the house of his brother
He was wild-eyed, haggard
he related his night's experience
An hour later came the
telegram
Holt's dwelling in
Chicago had been destroyed by fire
Her escape cut off
his wife
appeared at
window, her child in her arms
Just as the firemen
arrived with a ladder
the floor had given way
she was seen no more
The moment of this
was eleven o'clock and twenty-five minutes
