One day King Philip bought a fine horse
Bucephalus
king paid
high price for him
But he was wild
savage
no man could mount him
At last
king bade
servants take him away
"pity to ruin so fine a horse"
said Alexander
"Those men do not know how to treat him"
"Perhaps you can do better"
said his father scornfully
said Alexander
"give me leave to try"
"if you fail to do so"
asked Philip
"I will pay"
"price of the horse"
said the lad
everybody was laughing
Alexander ran
to Bucephalus
turned his head toward the sun
He had noticed
horse was afraid of his own shadow
spoke gently to the horse
patted him
quieted him
leaped upon the horse's back
Everybody expected to see
boy killed outright
But he kept his place
let the horse run
Bucephalus had become tired
Alexander reined him
rode back to
his father
his father
kissed him
"Macedon is too small"
"for you"
"seek a larger kingdom"
"worthy of you."
After that
Alexander and Bucephalus were the best of friends
horse
never allow any one to mount
but his master
Alexander became
most famous king
warrior
Bucephalus carried him
in many fierce battles
more than once
he save his master's life
