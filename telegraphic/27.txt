Mrs. Grove called from
door
towards
garden
no answer came
sun had set
full moon was rising
"Where is Amy?" she asked
"saw her go up stairs with her knitting"
"hour ago"
said Amy's brother
Mrs. Grove went
foot of the stairs
called again
no reply
So she went up
door of Amy's bedroom was shut
on pushing it open
saw her little girl sitting at the open window
lost in the beauty of
moonlit sky
"Amy"
child started
said quickly
"mother! Come and see!"
"What are you looking at"
she sat down by her side
"At the moon"
"stars"
"lake"
"by the hill"
"Isn't it beautiful"
"makes me feel so quiet and happy"
"I wonder why it is?"
"Shall I tell you"
"yes"
"God made everything that is good and beautiful"
"I know that"
"for the sake of man"
"man is the highest"
"creation"
"nearest to God"
"All things"
"created for his good"
"to use in sustaining"
"his body"
"soul"
"I don't see"
"use"
"of the moon and stars"
said Amy
"moon and stars give us light by night"
"I didn't think of that"
Amy replied
Her mother went on
"each of these good and beautiful things"
"comes"
"with a double blessing"
"one for our bodies"
"other for our souls"
"moon and stars not only give light"
"their calm presence fills our souls with peace"
"all things of nature"
"work of God"
"have in them"
"likeness of"
"himself not seen by our eyes"
"Do you understand"
"Just a little"
"Do you mean"
"God is inside"
"everything"
"he has made?"
"Not exactly"
"each created thing"
"mirror in which our souls"
"see something of his love"
"wisdom"
"In the water we see"
"image of his truth"
"In the sun"
"an image of his love"
"what in the moon?" asked Amy
"moon is cold and calm"
"tells us of God's love"
"Like truths learned"
"but not made warm and bright by love"
"you are too young to understand"
"Only keep"
"every"
"thing"
"made by God"
"reflects something of his nature"
"fill your heart with peace or delight"
this they sat looking out
window
feeling very peaceful
Then voice was heard below
"there is father"
taking her mother's hand
went down to meet him
