Having murdered his brother-in-law
Orrin Brower
was a fugitive
From the county jail
he had escaped
knocking down
jailer with an iron bar
As soon as he was out of the town he had the folly to enter a forest
night was pretty dark
he was
not long in losing himself
Suddenly he emerged
into an old road
before him saw
the figure of a man, motionless
too late to retreat
So the two stood there
A moment later
may have been an hour
the moon sailed into
unclouded sky
the hunted man saw
embodiment of Law lift an arm and point
toward and beyond him
He understood
he walked submissively
in the direction indicated
jailward
Only once
he looked backward
His captor was Burton Duff, the jailer
white as death
bearing upon his brow
mark of the iron bar
they entered the town
toward the jail
up to the main entrance
pushed it open without command
entered and found
half-dozen armed men
he turned
Nobody else entered
in the corridor lay the dead body of Burton Duff
