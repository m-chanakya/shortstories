At the end of these years I am very tired
Early
morning
throughout the day
at night
I have
studied in books
Now my brain is weary
I want rest
I shall sit
on the door-step beside my friend Paul
an idle fellow
He laughs when I upbraid him
He is listening to a thrush's song
tells me
thrush is singing a complaint
She wants her mate that was with her last blossom
She will have no other mate
will call for him till she hears the notes of her beloved-one's song
Paul is a strange fellow
He gazed idly at
cloud
He turns away from me
to drink deep the scent of
clover-field
rose-hedge
We rise
walk down to the foot of the
slope
He looks into the faces of people
tells me
in their eyes he reads
story of their souls
He knows men
women
children
why they look this way
that way
turn
to and fro
go and come
He is very wise
knows the language of God which I have not learned
