In answer
young lady
sent an invitation
children's party
Allow me
refuse your
invitation
You
mean well
your ideas
mistaken
Let us understand
I cannot
my mature age
participate
sports of children
I
sincerest regard
games
I
reached a time of life, when,
a
boy of ten hit me
the back
ask me
guess who
provokes
culminate in reckless criminality.
Nor can I
crawl
pretence that I am a bear
painful to me.
Neither can I look on
the Reverend
abandoning himself
appearing in the role of life and soul of the evening.
degradation of his holy calling grieves me
I
suspect him of ulterior motives.
your maiden aunt
help you to entertain the party
I
surmise
she will organize
guessing games
she
ask me to name a river in Asia beginning with a Z
my failure to do so
she
a hot plate down my neck as a forfeit
children will clap
These games
more adaptable intellect than mine
I cannot consent
I
not consider a five-cent pen-wiper from the top branch of a Xmas tree
adequate compensation
