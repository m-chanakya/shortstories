The Emperor
has sent a message
from his deathbed
to you alone
his pathetic subject, a
shadow which has taken refuge at
furthest distance
He ordered the herald to kneel
whispered the message to him
had the herald repeat it back
confirmed the accuracy
in front of
crowd
who have come to witness his death
he dispatched his herald. The messenger started off at once
makes his way through
he moves forward easily
But
crowd
so huge
If
an open field
he
fly along, and soon you
hear
his fist on your door
instead
how futile
his efforts
still forcing his way through
innermost palace
if
manage that
would
fight
down the steps
if
that
stride through
courtyards
the second palace
then again, stairs and courtyards
then
again, a palace, and so on for thousands of years
if
finally
the outermost door
the royal capital city
piled high
full of sediment. No one pushes his way through here
But you sit
dream
of
message when evening comes.
