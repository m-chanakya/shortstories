Three men
taking a walk
to while away the time
first man intended to go Somewhere
to look at
property
he was considering
second man
ready to go Anywhere
expected to be happy by the way
third man thought he was going Nowhere
he was a philosopher
held that time
space
only mental forms
Therefore
walked in silence
reflecting upon
vanity of whiling away an hour which did not exist
futility of going when staying was the same
other men
more simple
playing the oldest game in the world
giving names to
things
they saw
"Mutton"
said
Somewhere Man
"flock of sheep"
said
Anywhere Man
gazing upon the pasture
Nowhere Man meditated on
foolish habit of eating
said nothing
"ant-hill"
said
Anywhere Man
looking at a mound
"Pismires"
said
Somewhere Man
kicking the mound
"sting like the devil"
Nowhere Man
certain
devil is a myth
said nothing
"Briars"
said
Somewhere Man
"Blackberries"
said
Anywhere Man
Nowhere Man
to whom they referred
settlement of the first round
decided
both had lost because they spoke only of accidental phenomena
next round they came into
little forest
oak-trees
still bare
fir-trees
rusty green
maple-trees
in rosy bud
On these things
travellers
agreed
a vine trailed
with verdant leaves
under the leaves
clusters of rosy stars
said the Somewhere Man
"gravel-weed"
"because it marks the poorest soil"
said the Anywhere Man
"May-flowers"
"why?" asked the Nowhere Man
"May has not yet come"
"She is coming"
they entered a meadow
little bird was bubbling
with music
"Skunk-blackbird"
said
Somewhere Man
"colours the same as a skunk"
"Bobolink"
said
Anywhere Man
"silly name"
said
Nowhere Man
the two men did not play
by the same rules
They saw
thatched house
"Beastly hovel"
"Pretty cottage"
woman
tossing
fondling
her child
"Sickly sentiment"
"Mother love"
passed a youth sleeping
"Lazy hound!"
"Happy dog!"
third man
concluded
he was wasting his imaginary time
"I must bid you good-day"
"it seems to me"
"you are disputing only about appearances"
not likely to arrive Somewhere or Anywhere
he left them
went on his way Nowhere
I know not which
won the game
but I think
second man
had more pleasure in playing
