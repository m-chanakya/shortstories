One autumn
with some friends in a chateau
My friends
fond of practical jokes
gave me
princely reception
must have planned
joke
Every one
object of suspicion
hour
for retiring
entered the apartment
shut the door
inspected every article
shutters
shut them
drew the curtains
bed
suspicious-looking
caught hold of
mattress
dragged
into
middle of the room
fell asleep
awakened with a start
heavy body tumbling
on
my own
received on my face
a burning liquid
dreadful noise
jump
out of
sheets
into the corridor
found
valet
bringing me
tea
tripped over
obstacle in the middle
precautions
brought about the practical joke
trying to avoid
