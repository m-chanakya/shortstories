James Burne Worson was a shoemaker
who lived in Leamington, Warwickshire, England
he was somewhat addicted to drink
When in liquor he would make foolish wagers
On one of these too frequent occasions
For a stake of one sovereign
he undertook to run all the way to Coventry and back
He set out at once
the man with whom he had made the bet
accompanied by Barham Wise
and Hamerson Burns
following in a
wagon
For several miles Worson went on very well
The three men
kept a short distance
giving him occasional friendly
encouragement
Suddenly
in the very middle of the roadway
the man seemed to stumble
pitched headlong forward
uttered a terrible cry
and vanished!
No trace of him was ever discovered
the three men returned to Leamington
told their astonishing story
were afterward taken into custody
But
nothing ever transpired to discredit their sworn account
nevertheless
public opinion was divided
If they had something to conceal
their choice of means is certainly one of the most amazing ever made by sane human beings
