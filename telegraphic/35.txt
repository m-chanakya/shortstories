many years ago
there lived in Italy a little boy
Antonio Canova
with his grandfather
for his
father was dead
grandfather was a stone-cutter
was very poor
Antonio was
not strong enough to work
he liked to go with his grandfather to the stoneyard
While the old man was busy
lad would play
sometimes
make a little statue of soft clay
sometimes
cut a statue from a piece of rock
He showed so much skill
his grandfather was delighted
they went home in the evening
grandmother
would
sing
tell him stories that filled his mind with pictures of
beautiful things
next day
he would try to make some of those pictures
There lived in the same town a rich man
Count
Sometimes
Count would have a grand dinner
his rich friends
come to visit him
Antonio's grandfather
help
in the kitchen
for he was a fine cook
one day
Antonio went with his grandfather to the Count's
house
there was to be a grand feast
boy could not cook
not old enough to wait on the table
he was smart
he could help in
other ways
All went well
it was time to spread the table
there was a crash in the dining room
a man rushed into the kitchen
trembling with fright
"I have broken the statue"
servants were in trouble
Count would be very angry
Antonio
went up to the man
"let me try to make one?" asked Antonio
man laughed
"Nonsense!" he cried
"making statues on an hour's notice?
"Let the boy try"
said the servants, who knew him
since nothing else could be done
man allowed him to try
On the kitchen table
was a large square lump of yellow butter
With a kitchen knife
Antonio
carve this butter
In a few minutes
molded it into
shape of a
lion
"How beautiful!" they cried
man carried it to its place
When the Count and his friends came
they saw
yellow lion
"beautiful"
they cried
they asked
Count to tell
name of the artist
he called
his head servant
asked him
"It was carved"
"hour ago by a little boy in the kitchen," said the servant
Count bade the servant call the boy
"What is your name"
"who is your teacher"
"Antonio Canova," said the boy
"I have had no teacher but my grandfather the stonecutter"
guests
crowded around Antonio
famous artists among them
they knew
lad was a genius
Antonio should have a seat with them
dinner was
in his honor
next day
Count sent for Antonio to
live with him
best artists
employed to teach him
In a few years
Antonio
became
one of the greatest sculptors in the world
