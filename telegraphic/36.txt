Along the straight, glistening road
late October afternoon
a human tide was flowing
slowly
weary feet
numb brains
heavy hearts
the tide
flowed in two directions
Some fled away from ruined homes to escape
war
Some fled back
to escape the desolation of exile
But all were
anxious to be gone
I saw many separate things
A boy straining to push a wheelbarrow with his
mother in it
his two little sisters
at his side
peasant with his two girls
driving their lean
cows back to some
pasture
bony horse tugging
a wagon
heaped
with bedding and household gear
on top
sat
grandmother with
tiniest baby
vehicles crammed with passengers
foot-travellers
no tears
no cries of complaint
But beneath the numb
dazed faces I saw a question
"What have we done?"
Somewhere I heard a trumpet
German soldiers flashed for an instant
Through the humid dusk
came the
booming of the unseen guns
That was the only answer
