A great army was marching into Switzerland
If it
go much farther
no driving it out again
soldiers would burn the towns
rob the farmers
make slaves of the people
men of Switzerland knew all this
so they came from the mountains and valleys to try
to save their land
Some came with bows
scythes
pitchforks
sticks
clubs
their foes
fully armed
they moved
close together
What could the poor country people do against such foes
"break their lines"
cried their leader
bowmen shot
arrows
Others tried clubs and stones
lines were still unbroken
"If we cannot break their ranks"
said the Swiss
"our country will be lost"
Then a poor man
Arnold Winkelried
said
"I will give my life for my country"
"my friends"
"do your duty"
"Switzerland shall be free"
he ran forward
"Follow me"
he cried
He had nothing in his hands
he dashed
into the lines
hundred spears
turned to catch him
soldiers forgot to stay in their places
lines were broken
Arnold's friends rushed bravely after him
fought with whatever they had
had no
fear
only thought of their homes
they won at last
Switzerland was saved
Winkelried did not die in vain
