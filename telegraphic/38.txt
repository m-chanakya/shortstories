Dun
city
Visigoths
besieged it for months
fugitive
at midnight
to the tent of Alaric, the Chief
"Who are you?"
"the Avenger"
"in Dun"
"people"
"cruel to me"
"persecuted my family"
"just escaped"
"prison of Dun"
"tell you how the city may be taken"
"your price?"
"Vengeance"
capture of the city in the morning
The Avenger
through the open gate
bodies
lay where they had fallen
Empty
streets
His wrath sank
the bell-ringer
"Why are you here?"
"to ring the bells when peace comes"
"Ring now"
people
came
forth from
where they had been hiding
tears ran down his cheeks
"the fire of hatred is burnt out"
