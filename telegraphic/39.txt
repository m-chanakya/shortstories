Eckert lived
three miles from
town of Marion
lived alone
nobody
knew anything of his past
One day he disappeared
Nothing indicated preparation to leave
became a village tale
The house
considered "haunted"
five years after
to investigate
night session on the premises
Holcomb
Merle
Palmer
were to meet at Holcomb's house
go together to the scene
Palmer did not keep the engagement
others went to the Eckert house without him
awaited events
heard
sound of
door in the rear
footfalls in the room adjoining
a man entered
It was Palmer
walked slowly across the room
opening the front door passed out
both ran after him
neither they nor anyone
saw or heard of
Palmer
In
snow Palmer's trail
to the back door
conspicuous
from the front door nothing led away
Palmer's disappearance
as complete as that of "old man Eckert"
