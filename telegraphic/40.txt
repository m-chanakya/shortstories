Before the law sits a gatekeeper
a man
asks to gain entry
But the gatekeeper says
he cannot grant him entry at the moment
man
asks if he will be allowed
sometime later
"It is possible," says the gatekeeper
"but not now."
gate
stands open
as always
gatekeeper walks to the side
man bends over
to see
inside
gatekeeper
laughs and says
"try going inside"
"But take note"
"I am powerful"
"I am"
"most lowly gatekeeper"
"from room to room stand gatekeepers, each more powerful than the other"
man
has not expected such difficulties
he decides
to wait until he gets permission
gatekeeper gives him a stool
he sits for days and years
He makes many attempts to be let in
The gatekeeper
tells him
he cannot let him inside yet
man
who has equipped himself with many things for his journey
spends everything
to win over the gatekeeper
latter takes it all but
says
"I am taking this only so that you do not think you have failed to do anything"
He curses the unlucky circumstance
in the first years
out loud
later
he only mumbles
Finally
he no longer has much time to live
he gathers in his head all his experiences
into one question
"What do you still want to know now?" asks the gatekeeper
"Everyone strives after the law"
says the man
"how is it"
"no one except me has requested entry?"
gatekeeper
to reach his diminishing
hearing
shouts
"Here no one else can gain entry"
"this entrance was assigned only to you"
"I'm going now to close it"
