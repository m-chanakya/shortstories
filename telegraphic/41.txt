Benjamin Franklin
Though he stood before queens and kings
dressed in velvet
was the son of a poor couple
large family
born in Boston
two hundred years ago
baptized
named for his uncle Benjamin
made friends easily
never quiet
mischief he got into
neighbors loved him
One day
Benjamin
about seven
some one gave him
pennies
he ran to the toy shop
on his way he overtook a boy blowing a whistle
Ben thought
whistle was the nicest thing
offered his handful of pennies
boy took them
Ben rushed home
an older brother told him he had paid
too much for it
he burst out crying
When he was a grown man
going to buy something
he would wait
say to himself
"Careful"
"don't pay too much for your whistle"
Italian sculptor
heard this story made
statue called "Franklin and his Whistle"
Ben
wonderful swimmer
could manage a boat, too
spent half his play hours
at the wharves
One day
flying kites
thought
what would happen if
swimming with a kite tied to his waist
He tried it
kite pulled him along finely
to go slowly
he let out
string
to move
fast
he sent the kite up higher
in school
Ben did his best
his father wanted to make
great scholar
not money enough
so when he was ten he had to go
father's soap and candle shop to work
he hated
said to his father
"let me go to sea!"
"No," said Mr. Franklin
"your brother ran away to sea"
"I can't lose another boy"
father and son went round the city
visiting
work-shops
trade of making knives and tools
pleased Benjamin most
could not be learned until Mr. Franklin
paid one hundred dollars
James Franklin
older brother
learned the printing business in England
set up an office in Boston
Ben was put with him
had not been for the books he found
he could not have stayed six months
He sat up half the nights studying
James never gave him a chance for anything but work
When he found Ben could write poetry
well
he made him write ballads
sell them on the streets
putting the money
into his own pocket
He was very mean
began to strike Ben
boy left him
went to New York
found no work
worked his way to Philadelphia
his clothes were ragged
no suitcase
carried his extra stockings and shirts in his pockets
He was hungry
stepped into a baker's
had only one
dollar
asked for ten cents' worth of bread
baker gave him three large loaves
munching one
he had to carry the other two
under his arms
a girl standing in a doorway giggled
Years afterwards
Franklin was rich and famous
married this very girl
