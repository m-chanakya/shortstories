You
think
borrowing a match upon the street is a simple thing
any man
tried
will assure you
not, and will be prepared to swear to the truth of my experience
I was standing on
street with
cigar
I had no match. I waited till
ordinary-looking man came
I said:
"you oblige me"
"a match?"
"A match?" he said
"certainly."
"I know I have one,"
"it's in the bottom pocket—or"
"may be"
"top"
"wait"
"I put these parcels down"
"Oh, don't trouble," I said
"no consequence."
"Oh, it's no trouble"
"a minute"
"must be"
"somewhere"
digging his fingers into
pockets as he spoke
"isn't the waistcoat I generally…"
"Well, never mind," I protested
"it doesn't matter."
"hold on!" the man said, "I've got"
"here somewhere"
"No"
"not there either"
"I try"
"coat"
"confounded tailor"
"!"
He
pretty
worked up
thrown down
walking-stick
plunging at
pockets with
teeth set. "It's that cursed young boy of mine," he hissed
"bet"
"it's in"
"hip-pocket"
"hold up the tail of my overcoat"
"No, no," I protested
"it really doesn't matter
you needn't take off
overcoat
don't throw away your letters and things
and tear out
pockets
don't trample
overcoat and put your feet through the parcels. I
hate
hear you swearing at your
boy
don't tear your clothes
Suddenly
drew his hand
from
coat.
"I've got it," he cried
was a toothpick.
I pushed him under
trolley-car, and ran.
