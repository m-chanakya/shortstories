When Boulôt and Boulotte
twins
reached
age of twelve
decided in family council
time had come
to put their
feet into shoes
They
lived with
father
mother
troop of brothers
sisters
in
log cabin
They could
afford shoes
for they had saved many
picayune
selling
grapes, blackberries, and "socoes" to ladies
they selected
Saturday afternoon
for that is
great shopping time in Natchitoches
So
Saturday afternoon Boulôt and Boulotte
with their
picayunes
descended the hill
eager group
assembled to see them go
Long before
their return
same small band
ten year old Seraphine at their head
stationed themselves
before the cabin
Finally the twins
stepped into the clearing
"You bof crazy"
screamed Seraphine
"You go buy shoes"
"come home barefeet"
Boulôt flushed
looked
at his bare feet
then at the
brogans
he carried in his hand
He had not thought of it
Boulotte also carried shoes
But she was not
disconcerted
she retorted
"You think we go buy shoes fur ruin it in de dus'?"
