There was once
a king of Scotland
whose name was Robert Bruce
The King of England was at war with him
and had led a great army into Scotland
to drive him out
Six times had Bruce led his brave little army against his foes
six times had his men been beaten
At last
his army was scattered
he was forced to hide himself in the woods
One rainy day
Bruce lay on the ground under a rude shed
He was tired and sick
ready to give up all hope
As he lay thinking
he saw a spider
making ready to weave her web
Six times she tried
and six times it fell short
But the spider did not lose hope
she made ready to try for the seventh time
Bruce
watched her
Would she fail again?
No!
"I, too, will try a seventh time!" cried Bruce
Another battle was fought
the King of England was glad to go back into his own country
lesson which the little creature had taught the king was never forgotten
