small field,
girl lay sleeping
something awoke her
cabin
she dwelt
outside
enclosure in which she had been sleeping
round
hill
rails of the Texas and Pacific road
saw a long train
standing
sudden stopping
had awakened her
something wrong with the engine
some
passengers
went
to investigate
Others
strolling
in the direction of the cabin
tried to talk to Caline
pleasant-faced youngster
make
picture of the girl
summons from the train
all went
away
after that
She looked with
interest upon the trains
One day
talk with
flagman
people came from the great cities in the north
going to the city in the south
His sister lived there
would be glad
to have
Caline
help her cook
scrub
tend the babies
So she went
at first bewildered
flagman's sister
wanted to know how
girl liked it
very well
asked
again after another week
not so sure
again
questioned Caline
turned away
to cry unobserved
not the great city
she
sought
but the pleasant-faced boy, who
made her picture
