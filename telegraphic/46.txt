There was a great battle at sea
The flagship had taken fire
The deck was all ablaze
men who were left alive
launch a small boat
leaped into it
rowed swiftly away
Any other place was safer now than on board
There was powder in the hold
But the captain's son, young Casabianca
still stood upon the deck
His father had bidden him stand there
he had been taught always to obey
He saw the men leap into the boat
He heard them call to him to come
He shook his head
"O father!" he cried
"may I not go now?"
He did not know
his father was lying in the burning cabin below
a cannon ball had struck him dead at the very beginning of the fight
"Speak louder, father!" he cried
A great flash of light fills the air
"Boom!"
The blazing ship is seen no more
There was powder in the hold
