family of Christian Ashmore
two
daughters
a son
vicinity of Quincy, Illinois
Mr. Ashmore bought a farm
At some
distance
a spring
evening
young Charles Ashmore
started toward the spring
did not return
his father
went in search
snow had fallen
making
young man's trail conspicuous
trail
abruptly ended
the man proceeded to the spring
covered with ice
Returning
noted
both sides of the trail
No tracks led away
morning light showed nothing more
Four days later
mother
went to the spring
heard the voice of her son
what the voice
said
unable to tell
for months afterward
voice was heard by
several members of the family
none could determine its direction
nor
its words
intervals of silence grew longer
voice fainter
by midsummer
heard no more
