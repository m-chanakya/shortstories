Pythias had done something which the tyrant Dionysius did not like
he was dragged to prison
a day was set when he should be put to death
"give me leave to go home and say good-bye"
he said
"I will come back"
tyrant laughed
"How can I know"
"you will keep your promise?"
he said
Then
Damon spoke
"put me in prison in place of my friend"
"let him go"
"if he is not here on the day which you have set"
"I will die in his stead"
tyrant was surprised
at last agreed
Time passed
Pythias
had not come back
Damon did not try to escape
had faith in
his friend
At last the day came
Damon was ready to die
but at the same moment Pythias stood in the door
He had been delayed by storms
He greeted Damon
gave himself into the hands of the jailer
tyrant
could see good in others
He felt
Damon and Pythias
ought not to suffer unjustly
set them both free
