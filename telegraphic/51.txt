Dan Murphy enlisted as
private
fought
bravely
boys all liked him
when a wound
weakened him down
carrying a musket
too heavy work for him
they
fixed him up as a sutler
He made money
sent it always to his wife
She
knew
to keep money when she got it
didn't waste a penny
began to get miserly as
bank account grew
she had known what it was to be hungry, cold, friendless
without a dollar in the world
Dan died
the boys
telegraphed
Mrs. Murphy to know if she
like
him
sent home
Mrs. Murphy jumped
conclusion
only cost two or three dollars to embalm
she telegraphed "Yes"
at the "wake"
bill
arrived
She uttered
sad wail
pierced every heart
"Sivinty-foive dollars"
"such expinsive curiassities"
