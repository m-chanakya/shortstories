At Corinth
there lived
wise man
Diogenes
But
he had
queer ways
he said
no man needed much
so he
not live
house
slept in a tub
which he rolled
from place to place
He spent
days sitting in
sun
saying wise things to those
around
At noon one day
Diogenes
walking
the streets
with
lantern
in search of something
"Why"
"lantern when"
"sun"
"shining?" some one said
"looking for an honest man"
answered Diogenes
When Alexander
went to Corinth
all the foremost men
came
to
praise him
Diogenes did not come
he was the only man for whose opinions Alexander cared
king went to see the wise man
He found Diogenes
lying on the ground
enjoying
the sun
he sat up and looked at Alexander
Alexander greeted him
"I have heard"
"about your wisdom"
"Is there anything"
"I can do for you?"
"Yes," said Diogenes
"stand a little on one side"
"so as not to keep the sunshine from me"
king was
surprised
But
not
angry
made him admire
more
he turned to ride back
said to his officers
"if I"
"not"
"Alexander"
"like to be Diogenes"
