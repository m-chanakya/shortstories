Dhar Ry
in his room
Ejon Khee entered
"the Earth rocket"
"due to land"
"thousand miles away, if their calculations are correct"
"telepath teams"
"reading their thoughts"
"but"
"first physical contact between Mars and Earth"
"Why"
"atomic warhead?"
"spectroscopic analysis"
civilization of Mars
dying
one city, nine hundred people
waiting for Earth to make contact
Martian civilization
no technology
developed social sciences
parapsychological sciences of the mind
Mars could teach Earth
How to avoid crime and war
Earth would
by science and technology
rehabilitate a dying planet
Ry
and Khee
watched toward the north, where the rocket should land
on Earth's moon
"Thar she blew"
"Hope it didn't kill anybody"
"did it hit dead center"
"maybe a thousand miles off, to the south"
"think there are any Martians?"
"No"
He was right
