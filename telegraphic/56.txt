Tamlane
Burd Janet
loved one another
But when
time came near for
marrying
Tamlane disappeared
many days after
Janet was wandering in Carterhaugh Wood
she had been warned not to
She came
to a bush of broom
began plucking it
when by her side
started
Tamlane
"Where come ye from"
"why"
"away so long?"
"From Elfland"
said
Tamlane
"Queen of Elfland has made me her knight"
"how did you get there"
said
Janet
"I was hunting one day"
"round yon hill"
"deep drowsiness fell upon me"
"when I awoke"
"I was in Elfland"
"Fair is that land and gay"
"I stop but for thee and one other thing"
"Every seven years the Elves pay their tithe to the Nether world"
"I fear it is myself that will be the tithe"
"can you not be saved?"
"only thing is there for my safety"
"Tomorrow"
"Hallowe'en"
"fairy court"
"ride through England and Scotland"
"you must"
"stand by Miles Cross between twelve and one"
"with holy water"
"cast a compass all around you"
"But how shall I know you"
"amid so many knights"
"first court"
"let pass"
"next court"
"do naught"
"But the third court"
"is the chief court"
"at the head rides the Queen"
"I shall ride by her side"
"milk-white steed"
"star in my crown"
"Watch my hands"
"right one will be gloved"
"left one will be bare"
"how to save you"
quoth
Janet
"spring upon me suddenly"
"I will fall"
"seize me quick"
"whatever change befall me"
"cling hold to me till they turn me into red-hot iron"
"Then cast me into this pool"
"Cast then your green mantle over me"
"I shall be yours"
Janet promised to do all
next night at midnight
took her stand by Miles Cross
cast a compass round her with holy water
Soon
came riding by the Elfin court
first
went a troop
then another
in the third court
she saw the Queen
by her side a knight
she knew this was
Tamlane
springing forward
pulled its rider down
seized him in her arms
all came around her
tried their spells on
Tamlane
they turned him
like frozen ice
a huge flame
an adder
a snake
a dove
a swan
at last
a red-hot glaive
this she cast into a well of water
cast her green mantle over him
Tamlane was Burd Janet's for ever
Elfin court rode away
Janet
Tamlane went
homewards
married
Tamlane
sained by the holy water
made Christian once more
