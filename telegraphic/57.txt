Two friends
one
fat
other
thin
met at
Nikolaevsky station
fat man
just dined in the station
thin man
just slipped out of the train
thin woman with a long chin, his wife
tall schoolboy with one eye screwed up
behind his back
"Porfiry," cried the fat man
seeing the thin man
"How many summers, how many winters!"
cried the thin man
"Misha! The friend of my childhood!"
"This is unexpected!"
"Come have a good look at me!"
"Just as great a darling and a dandy"
"how are you? Made your fortune? Married? I am married"
"This is my wife Luise"
"this is my son Nafanail"
"This is the friend of my childhood, Nafanya"
Nafanail
took off his cap
"Don't be shy, Nafanya"
"Go nearer to him"
Nafanail
took refuge behind his father's back
"how are you doing my friend?" the fat man asked
"Are you in the service? What grade have you reached?"
"I have been a collegiate assessor for"
"two years"
"I have the Stanislav"
"salary is poor"
"wife gives music lessons"
"I go in for carving wooden cigarette cases"
"I served as a clerk"
"been transferred here as a head clerk"
"what about you?"
"I have risen to privy councillor already"
thin man turned pale
rigid
but soon his face twisted in
broadest smile
His wife's long chin grew longer still
Nafanail drew himself up to attention
fastened all the buttons
"Your Excellency"
"delighted!"
"The friend"
"of childhood"
"turned into such a great man"
fat man frowned
"there is no need of this official obsequiousness!"
"What are you saying"
sniggered the thin man
"Your Excellency's gracious attention is like refreshing manna"
fat man was about to
protest
but
thin man wore an expression of such reverence
councillor was sickened
He turned away
giving him his hand at parting
thin man pressed three fingers
bowed
sniggered like a Chinaman
"He--he--he!"
wife smiled
Nafanail scraped with his foot
dropped his cap
All
were
overwhelmed
