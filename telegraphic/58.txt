"Press me no more Mr. Snooper"
said Gladys
"I can never be yours"
Bertram D. Snooper

ambitious
talented young lawyer
just lost his first suit
dared to aspire
hand of Gladys
beautiful
talented daughter of one of the oldest
proudest families in the county
"Why will you not marry me?" he asked
"Because"
said Gladys
"progression and enlightenment"
"woman of today possesses demand"
"man"
"bring to the marriage altar"
"heart and body"
"free from"
"debasing"
"iniquities"
"You have been reading books"
"Besides that," continued Gladys
"you have no money"
"Stay here"
he said
"I will be back in fifteen years"
When he had gone
Gladys felt
yearning
"I wonder"
"cold cabbage left from dinner"
She
left the room
a dark-complexioned man
black hair
gloomy
came out of the fireplace
"Gladys"
"shall be mine"
"I have papers to prove"
"Bertram Snooper is the heir to the Tom Bean estate"
"and"
"Gladys' grandfather"
"a cook in Major Rhoads Fisher's command"
"Therefore, the family repudiate her"
"he will marry me"
"to drag their proud name down"
"Ha, ha, ha!"
this man was
Henry R. Grasty
with a sardonic laugh left for New York
Fifteen years have elapsed
Gladys
Henry
stood at the marriage altar
preacher
about to pronounce the fatal words
fell off
Bertram D. Snooper entered
held a Statesman in his hand
"Here is a paper noticing my arrival"
handed it to Henry
It was dated three weeks after
"Foiled again!" he hissed
"Bertram"
said Gladys
"why have you come between me and Henry?
"I have just discovered"
"I am the sole heir to Tom Bean's estate"
"worth two million dollars"
Gladys threw herself in Bertram's arms
Henry
drew from his
pocket
467 pages of closely written foolscap
"I ask you to read that"
he said
handing it to Bertram
no sooner read the document
he uttered
shriek
"All is lost"
he said
"What is that document?" asked Gladys
"it deprives me of my entire fortune"
"But I care not"
"since I have won you"
"What is it?
said Gladys
"Those papers"
said Henry
"are the proofs of my appointment as administrator of the Tom Bean estate"
Gladys threw herself in Henry R. Grasty's arms
Twenty minutes later Bertram
was seen
enter a beer saloon
