"I want"
"marry your daughter," said Mark Spayley
"I"
"artist"
"income"
"two hundred a year"
"she"
"daughter"
"wealthy man, so I suppose you"
"think my offer"
"piece of presumption."
Duncan Dullamy,
great company inflator,
was secretly relieved at the prospect of
husband for his daughter Leonore. A crisis
rushing upon him
he
emerge with neither money nor credit
his
ventures
fallen flat
flattest of all
new breakfast food, Pipenta
no one bought
"you marry Leonore if she"
"poor man's daughter?" asked the man
"Yes," said Mark
Leonore's father
gave his consent
suggested
early date for
wedding.
"show my gratitude in some way," said Mark
"Get people to buy that"
said Dullamy, nodding
at
Pipenta
"It wants a better name," said Mark
"I'll have a shot at it."
Three weeks later the world was advised
new breakfast food
name of "Filboid Studge."
One
poster depicted the Damned in Hell suffering a new torment from their inability to get
the Filboid Studge which
fiends held
just beyond their reach. The scene
more gruesome by
suggestion of the features of leading men and women of the day
dimly recognizable
The poster bore no
allusions to the merits of
food, but a
statement
"They cannot buy it now."
Spayley
grasped
that people will do things from a sense of duty which they would never attempt as a pleasure.
No one
eaten Filboid Studge as a pleasure
its advertisement drove housewives
to the grocers' shops to clamour for
immediate supply
Once
womenfolk discovered
it
unpalatable, their
forcing it on
households knew no bounds.
A bishop
preached against the poster
a peer's daughter died from eating too
infantry regiment mutinied and shot its officers rather than eat the nauseous mess
Filboid Studge
become a household word
Dullamy
realized
not
last word in breakfast dietary
he sold
his interests in the article which
brought him
wealth
Leonore,
now
heiress
greater
than
before, he
found her
higher in
husband market
Mark Spayley
left to curse the day he produced the
poster.
