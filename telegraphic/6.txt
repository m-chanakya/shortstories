A long time ago
in the province of Tamba
lived a rich merchant named Inamuraya Gensuke
He had a daughter called O-Sono
he sent her
to Kyoto
that she might be trained in the polite accomplishments taught to the ladies of the capital
After she had thus been educated
she was married
They had one child
But O-Sono fell ill
died
On the night after the funeral of O-Sono
her little son said
that his mamma had come back
and was in the room upstairs
Then some of the family went upstairs
they were startled to see
the figure of the dead mother
standing in front of a tansu, or chest of drawers
the folk were afraid
the mother of O-Sono's husband said:
"O-Sono was much attached to her belongings"
"she has come back to look at them"
"If we present O-Sono's robes and girdles to the temple"
"her spirit will probably find rest"
the following morning
all of O-Sono's ornaments and dresses were taken to the temple
But she came back the next night
and every night
mother of O-Sono's husband
went to the parish-temple
told the chief priest all that had happened
asked for ghostly counsel
head-priest was a learned old man
known as Daigen Osho
Daigen Osho went to the house
found the room
remained there alone
reading the sutras
the figure of O-Sono suddenly outlined itself in front of the tansu
she kept her eyes fixed upon the tansu
The priest
said
"I have come here in order to help you"
"Perhaps in that tansu there is something about which you have reason to feel anxious"
"Shall I try to find it for you?"
shadow appeared to give assent
He found nothing
Suddenly it occurred to him
there might be something hidden under the paper with which the drawers were lined
under the lining of the lowermost drawer he foundâ€”a letter
"Shall I burn it for you?"
he asked
She bowed before him
"It shall be burned in the temple this very morning,"
he promised
"and no one shall read it, except myself."
The figure smiled and vanished
Dawn was breaking
the priest descended the stairs
to find the family waiting anxiously below
he said to them:
"She will not appear again."
she never did
The letter was burned
It was a love-letter written to O-Sono in the time of her studies at Kyoto
priest alone knew what was in it
the secret died with him
