good master
many slaves
slaves praised their master
"does good to us"
"speaks well to us"
Devil was wroth
took possession of one of the slaves
whose name was Aleb
Aleb
said:
"Vainly do ye praise"
"master"
"do him evil"
"will render evil for evil"
they
laid a wager
Aleb undertook to provoke
master
if he did not provoke him
should lose his festival garment, but if he did
each one
give him his festival garment
Aleb served
in the sheep-folds
in the morning
master came to the sheep-folds with his guests
wanted to show them his best ram
the guests could not distinguish the precious ram
the Devil's labourer
scared the sheep
all intermingled
"Aleb"
"Catch the best ram"
Aleb
seized the priceless ram
tugged the leg
it snapped
master turned
black as night
silent for a time
fixed his eyes on heaven
He looked at Aleb, smiled
said:
"my master is stronger than thine"
"I will not punish thee"
"as thou didst desire thy freedom"
"I release thee"
"take thy festival garment with thee"
master went home
Devil gnashed his teeth
