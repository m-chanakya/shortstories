At Denver
influx of passengers into
eastbound B. & M. Express
In one coach
sat
pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste
surrounded by
luxurious comforts
Among the newcomers
two young men
one of handsome presence
frank countenance
other a ruffled
glum-faced
heavily built
roughly dressed
two were handcuffed together
only vacant seat
one facing
young woman
seated themselves
woman's glance fell upon them
she spoke
"Mr. Easton"
"Don't you ever recognize old friends"
younger man roused himself
at the sound of her voice
seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly
clasped her fingers with his left hand
"Miss Fairchild," he said
"excuse the other hand"
"it's otherwise engaged"
glad look in the girl's eyes
changed to
horror
Easton
amused
about to speak again
when the other forestalled him
"excuse me for speaking, miss"
"I see you're acquainted with the marshall"
"ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen"
"it'll make things easier for me"
"Leavenworth prison"
"seven years for counterfeiting"
"So that is what you are doing out here? A marshal!"
"I had to do something"
"takes money to keep step with our crowd in Washington"
"well, a marshalship isn't quite as high a"
"ambassador, but--"
"The ambassador," said the girl
"doesn't call any more"
"You ought to know that"
girl's eyes, fascinated
upon
handcuffs
"Don't you worry"
said the other man
"All marshals handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away"
"Will we see you again soon in Washington?" asked the girl
"Not soon"
said Easton
"I love the West," said the girl
"I could live"
"be happy in the West"
"air here agrees with me"
"Money isn't everything"
"people always misunderstand things"
"remain stupid--"
"Mr. Marshal," growled the glum-faced man
"haven't had a smoke all day"
"Take me in the smoker"
"won't you?"
Easton
slow smile on his face
"can't deny a petition for tobacco,"
"the one friend of the unfortunate"
"Good-bye, Miss Fairchild"
"Duty calls"
two men sidled down
into the smoker
two passengers
near by had heard most of the conversation
Said one
"That marshal's a good sort of chap"
"Pretty young to hold an office like that, isn't he?" asked the other
"Young!" exclaimed the first
"didn't you catch on?"
"did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand?"
