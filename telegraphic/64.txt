second decade of the Twentieth Century
after the Great Plague
Sickness had swept away
Royal Family
unto the third and fourth generations
thus
Hermann
thirtieth in the order of succession
found himself
ruler of the British dominions
In many ways he was the most progressive monarch
his Ministers
found it difficult to keep pace with his legislative suggestions
admitted the Prime Minister
"we are hampered by"
"votes-for-women creatures"
"they disturb our meetings"
"They must be dealt with" said Hermann
"how?"
"I will draft"
"a Bill," said the King
"optional"
"for male electors"
"but every woman"
"obliged to vote"
"not only at elections for Parliament"
"local functionaries"
"failure to vote"
"penalty of 10 pounds"
"Absence"
"unsupported by an adequate medical certificate"
"not be accepted"
Compulsory Female Franchise
demanding the vote
bulk of the women
indifferent or hostile to the franchise agitation
In the country districts
carrying out
new Act was irksome
in the towns and cities
incubus
There seemed no end to the elections
Laundresses and seamstresses
hurry away from their work to vote
for a candidate
they selected at haphazard
clerks and waitresses got up extra early
Society women found their arrangements impeded
parties
holidays became
a masculine luxury
for the accumulation of 10 pound fines during a prolonged absence
even
wealthy folk could hardly afford
female disfranchisement
became a formidable movement
No-Votes-for-Women League numbered
by the million
"We Don't Want to Vote"
became a popular refrain
Government showed no signs of being impressed
more violent methods came into vogue
Still the Government
adhered to its conviction
as a last resort
The Great Weep was organized
Relays of women
wept continuously in the public places
"What are we to do?" asked the Prime Minister
said the King
"time to yield"
"Pass a measure"
"depriving women of the right to vote"
As the Minister withdrew
Hermann
gave a profound chuckle
"more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream"
he quoted
