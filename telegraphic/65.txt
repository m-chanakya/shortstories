The following I find in a
paper
coincidence between
own experience and that here
by
Mr. Benton
remarkable
I
commenting
paper says:
T. H. Benton to his mother's influence
"mother asked"
"never to use tobacco; I"
"never touched"
"from that time"
"asked me not to gamble"
"I"
"never gambled"
"She admonished"
"against liquor-drinking"
"usefulness"
"through life, I attribute to having complied with her"
"wishes. When I"
"seven"
"she asked"
"not to drink"
"then I"
"total abstinence"
"I"
"adhered"
"I owe to my mother"
It
almost an exact
own moral career
substituting
grandmother
mother
my grandmother's asking
not to use tobacco
She said
"don't ever"
"before breakfast"
I
never touched
at that hour
to the present day.
She asked me not to gamble
said, "Put up"
"cards"
"two pair and a jack"
"other fellow's got a flush!"
I never have gambled
without
"cold deck" in my pocket
When I
two years
she
me not to drink
I
total abstinence
I
adhered
enjoyed the
effects
I owe to my grandmother
never drunk
from that day
any kind of water.
