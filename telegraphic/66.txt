stranger in Honolulu
safe bet
he is either a missionary or captain of a whaler
captains
ministers
form one-half of the population
fourth is
common Kanakas
mercantile foreigners
their families
final fourth is
high officers of the Hawaiian Government
A solemn stranger met me
one day
said
"Good morning, your reverence"
"Preach in the stone church yonder"
"I'm not a preacher"
"I beg your pardon, captain"
"How much oil--"
"I'm not a whaler"
"pardons, your Excellency"
"Major-General in the household troops"
"Minister of the Interior"
"Secretary of War?"
"Gentleman of the Bedchamber?"
"Commissioner of the Royal--"
"I'm not connected"
"with the government"
"who the mischief are you?"
"a private personage"
"lately arrived from America"
"too blissful to be true"
"Excuse these tears"
"sixteen weary years I have yearned for a moment like this"
his feelings were too much for him
I pitied this poor creature
I shed a few tears on him
then took what small change he had, and "shoved."
