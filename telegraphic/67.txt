Once there was a war between
Roman people and
Etruscans who lived
on the other side of the Tiber River
Porsena
King of the Etruscans
raised a great army
marched toward Rome
Romans
knew
they were not strong enough
So they kept
inside of their walls
set guards to watch the roads
One morning
army of Porsena was seen
marching
toward the wooden bridge which spanned the river
"If they"
"gain the bridge"
"we cannot hinder them"
among the guards at the bridge
was a brave man
Horatius
He was on
farther side of the river
when he saw
Etruscans were
near
he called out
"Hew down the bridge"
"I, with the two men who stand by me"
"keep the foe at bay"
On the bridge
Romans hewed
it
was ready to fall
"Come back"
"save your lives"
they cried
But just then Porsena's horsemen dashed
"Run"
said Horatius to his friends
They
ran back across the bridge
bridge toppled over
Horatius
moved
backward till he stood on the river's bank
A dart thrown by
Porsena's soldiers
put out his left eye
he did not falter
cast his spear at
horseman
turned
leaped into
stream
He still had his
armor on
he sank
But he was
strong
best swimmer in Rome
next minute he rose
he reached the farther side
his friends
greeted him
Porsena's men
also
could not help but praise
Romans
were
grateful
called him Horatius Cocles
"one-eyed Horatius"
a fine statue of brass
made in his honor
and
gave him
land
