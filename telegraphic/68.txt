some times it is a
relief
to make a confession
yet I almost believe
I am moved to do it more
to bring censure upon another man
I lectured in Newark lately
During the afternoon
I was talking with
young gentlemen just referred to
he said he had an uncle who
grown permanently bereft of all emotion
with tears
young man said
"if I could"
"see him laugh once more!"
"if I could"
"see him weep!"
I was touched
"Bring him to my lecture"
"I'll start him for you"
"If you could but do it"
"all our family would bless you"
I was profoundly moved
young man blessed me
wept on my neck
went after his uncle
He placed him
in the second row
I tried him with mild jokes
severe ones
bad jokes
good ones
stale jokes
new ones
ranted till I was hoarse
sick
frantic
furious
but I never moved him once
I sat down bewildered
exhausted
president of the society came
bathed my head with cold water
"What made you carry on so toward the last?"
"I was trying to make that confounded old fool laugh"
he said:
"you were wasting your time"
"he is deaf"
"dumb"
"blind"
was that any way for that old man's nephew to impose on a stranger and orphan like me?
