In the beginning
when the world
was
new
Animals
just beginning to work for Man
there was a Camel
lived in the middle of
Desert
because he did not want to work
when anybody spoke to him he said
Just "Humph!" and no more
Horse came to him on Monday morning
saddle on his back
"Camel, come out and trot"
"Humph!"
Horse went away
told the Man
Dog came
a stick in his mouth
"Camel, come and fetch and carry"
"Humph!"
Dog went away
told the Man
Ox came
yoke on his neck
"Camel, come and plough"
"Humph!"
Ox went away
told the Man
Man called
Horse
Dog
Ox
"I'm very sorry for you"
"but that Humph-thing in the Desert can't work"
"you must work double-time to make up for it"
That made the Three very angry
they held a
palaver
indaba
punchayet
pow-wow on the edge of the Desert
Camel came
laughed at them
said "Humph!"
went away
there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts
"Djinn of All Deserts," said the Horse
"is it right for any one to be idle, with the world so new-and-all"
"Certainly not," said the Djinn
said the Horse
"a thing in the middle of your"
"Desert"
"long neck"
"long legs"
"hasn't done a stroke of work since Monday"
said the Djinn
"that's my Camel"
"What does he say about it?"
"Humph!"
"Does he say anything else?"
"Only "Humph!""
Djinn
took a bearing across the desert
found the Camel
idle
looking at his
reflection
"what's this I hear of your doing no work"
"Humph!"
Djinn sat down
began to think a Great Magic
"You've given the Three extra work ever since Monday"
"Humph!"
"I shouldn't say that again if I were you"
"I want you to work"
Camel said "Humph!" again
no sooner had he said it
he saw his back
puffing up into a
big
humph
"That's your"
"own humph"
"you've brought upon"
"self by not working"
"Today is Thursday"
"you are going to work"
"How can I," said the Camel
"with this humph"
"That's made a-purpose"
said the Djinn
"because you missed"
"three days"
"You will be able to work now for three days without eating"
"because you can live on your humph"
"Come out"
"go to the Three"
"behave"
from that day to this
Camel always wears a humph
(we call it "hump" now, not to hurt his feelings)
he has never yet caught up with the three days
he missed
he has never yet learned how to behave
