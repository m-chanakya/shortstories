ONCE upon a time
uninhabited island
shores of
Sea
there lived
Parsee
the Parsee lived
with nothing but
hat
knife and
cooking-stove
one day he
made himself
cake
and he baked it
just as he was going to eat
it
came down to the beach
one Rhinoceros with
few manners
In those days the Rhinoceros's skin fitted him quite tight
no wrinkles in it
Parsee left
cake
climbed
palm tree with nothing
but
hat
Rhinoceros upset the oil-stove
cake rolled on the sand
he ate it
he went away
Parsee came down
recited
Them that takes cakes Which the Parsee-man bakes Makes dreadful mistakes.
weeks later
heat wave
everybody
took off
clothes
Rhinoceros took off
skin
carried
over
shoulder
to
beach to bathe
those days it buttoned underneath
He waddled
into
water
leaving
skin
on
beach
Parsee came by
found
skin
he went to
camp
filled
hat with cake-crumbs
He took
skin
he shook
he scrubbed
he rubbed
just as full of
tickly cake-crumbs
as
it could
hold
he climbed
palm-tree
waited for
Rhinoceros to
put it on
the Rhinoceros did
it tickled like cake crumbs
he
scratch
made
worse
he
rolled
tickled him worse
he
palm-tree
rubbed himself against it
rubbed his skin into a
fold
and another fold
he rubbed
buttons off
he rubbed
more folds
legs
spoiled his temper
it didn't make
difference to
cake-crumbs
went home
angry
scratchy
from that day
every rhinoceros has great folds
in
skin
and
bad temper
account of
cake-crumbs
inside
