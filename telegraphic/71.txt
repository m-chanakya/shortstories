IN the sea
once upon a time
was a Whale
All
fishes he could find in all the sea he ate
Till
only one small fish left
a
'Stute Fish
he swam
behind the Whale's right ear
to be out of harm's way
Whale
said
"I'm hungry"
Stute Fish said
"ever tasted Man"
"No"
said the Whale
"What is it like?"
"Nice but nubbly"
"fetch me some"
said the Whale
"One at a time is enough"
said the 'Stute Fish
"swim to latitude Fifty North"
"longitude Forty West"
"sitting on a raft"
"middle of the sea"
"with nothing on but"
"blue canvas breeches"
"a pair of suspenders"
"jack-knife"
"ship-wrecked Mariner"
"is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity"
Whale swam
he found
Mariner
Whale opened his mouth back
till it nearly touched his tail
he swallowed
Mariner
raft
smacked his lips
as soon as
Mariner
found himself
inside
he stumped
jumped
Whale felt
unhappy
he said to the 'Stute Fish
"man is very nubbly"
"making me hiccough"
"What shall I do"
"Tell him to come out"
said the 'Stute Fish
Whale called down
to the
Mariner
"Come out"
"behave yourself"
"I've"
"hiccoughs"
'Nay, nay!' said the Mariner
"Take me to my natal-shore"
"white-cliffs-of-Albion"
"I'll think about it"
he began to dance more
"better take him home"
said the 'Stute Fish
Whale swam
as hard as he could for the hiccoughs
at last
saw
Mariner's natal-shore
rushed half-way up the beach
opened his mouth wide
Mariner walked out
But while the Whale had been swimming
Mariner
cut up the raft into a
grating
tied it
with his suspenders
dragged
grating
into the Whale's throat
there it stuck!
he stepped out
went home
married
lived happily ever afterward
So did the Whale
But
the grating
he could neither cough up nor swallow down
prevented him eating anything except
very small fish
that is the reason
whales nowadays never eat men
boys
little girls
'Stute Fish
hid himself
He was afraid
Whale might be angry
