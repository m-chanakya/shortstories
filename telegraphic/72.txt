The wind was frolicking
thick drops fell upon us
man
overtook us
bottle under his arm
"grave of Mushkin, the actor?"
he asked us
"You are a government clerk"
"?"
"No, an actor"
found the actor's grave
overgrown with weeds
"subscription for a monument to him was got up among actors"
"but they drank up the money"
"already forgotten"
"I"
"never forget him"
"got nothing but harm from him"
"through looking at him"
"I became an actor"
"An actor's lot is a bitter one!"
"ruined for nothing"
Though I don't like him
he was the only one I had
last time I shall visit him
soon die of drink
We left the actor
with
dead Mushkin
went on
began drizzling
