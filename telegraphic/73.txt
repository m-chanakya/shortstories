"Could you give me"
"information respecting"
"islands"
"government is going to purchase?"
uncle of mine
wants to know
He is
industrious
well disposed
wants to make
living
honest
humble way
he wants to be quiet
wishes to settle down
He has been to
new island St. Thomas
he thinks things
unsettled there
He went
with an attache of the State Department
to pay for the island
had his money in
same box
when they went ashore
sailors broke open the box
took all the money
he came home
got some more
went back
then he took the fever
seven kinds of fever down there
by reason of loss of sleep
general wear and tear
he failed to cure
first fever
got the other six
But he
got well
started a farm
next day
great storm came
washed
most of it over to Gibraltar
Then he invested in a mountain
started a farm
to be out of the way when the sea came ashore
an earthquake came
next night
shook it all down
all fragments
so mixed up with another man's property
he could not tell which were his
without going to law
he would not do that
because his main object
was to be quiet
he wanted to start a brickyard
bought a flat
put out a hundred thousand bricks to dry
A volcano shoved
through there that night
elevated his brickyard about two thousand feet
It irritated him
bricks are all baked
can't get them down
first
he thought
government would get the bricks down
since
it ought to protect
property where a man has invested
but all he wants is quiet
so he is not going to apply for the subsidy
He went back
last week
in a couple of ships
to prospect
coast for a safe place for a farm
a great "tidal wave" came
hoisted both
ships out into one of the interior counties
he came near losing his life
now he don't know what to do
He has tried Alaska
but the bears kept after him
That is how he came to
St. Thomas
But he
think St. Thomas is not quiet enough
He has heard
government is thinking
buying Porto Rico
he wishes to try Porto Rico
if it is
quiet
How is Porto Rico for his style
think the government will buy it?
