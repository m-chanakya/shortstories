finest work of man is
children
up to the age of ten
after that they become men or women
and
not worth what they cost
Watch them playing
prettily
innocently
with slippers
household utensils
leaving
which displeases them
crying after
which pleases them
munching the sweets
laughing as soon as their teeth are cut
you will agree
they are
lovable
ingredient of reason in the naivety of a man
while
naivety of children is candid
immaculate
Queen Catherine was at
Dauphine
to make herself welcome to
king
her
father-in-law
who
was very ill
presented him
from time to time
Italian pictures
knowing
he liked them
being a friend of
Raphael
Primatice
Leonardo
She obtained from her family
a precious picture
painted by
Titian
of Adam and Eve
when God left them to wander
Paradise
painted their full height
in the costume of the period
picture was put into
room of
king
who was then ill
everyone wished to see it
but no one was able to until
king's death
One day
Catherine took
to the king's room
son Francis
little Margot
these children
heard this picture of Adam and Eve spoken about
tormented their mother to take them
Since the two
at times amused the old king
Dauphine consented
she left them
before Titian's picture
"Which of the two is Adam?" said Francis
nudging his sister
replied she
"to know that"
"they"
"have to be dressed"
This reply
delighted the poor king and the mother
