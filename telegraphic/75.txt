OLD MAC used to sleep in his wagon
one time
lucky
trip
looked in at
Royal Hotel to wet his luck
Next morning
mind was made up
to be a gentleman for once
bought
suit
shirt
during the day
drinks
concluded about midnight
all the rooms
full
shake-down on the balcony
Towards daylight he woke
reached out
rail of the balcony
to him
rail of the side of his wagon
instinctive intention of getting down
got
leg over
felt
for the hub of the wheel
found
projecting ledge of the balcony
swung his other leg
fell
fifteen feet
into a
gutter
thereafter
veranda of a one-storied shanty
good enough
