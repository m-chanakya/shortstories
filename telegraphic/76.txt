John Mortonson was dead
body
in a
coffin fitted with a plate of glass
All arrangements for
funeral
well attended
deceased
would
have approved
members of the family came
every few minutes
wept
This did them no good
did no good to John
hour of two approached
friends began to arrive
offering
consolation to
relatives
seated themselves
Then the minister came
followed by
the widow
She approached the casket
after leaning her face against
glass for a moment
gently led to a seat near her daughter
man of God began his eulogy
gloomy day grew darker
few drops of rain fell
seemed as
nature were weeping
minister
finished his eulogy with prayer
a hymn was sung
pall-bearers took their places
widow ran to the coffin
sobbed hysterically
Gradually
becoming more composed
as the minister was
leading her away
She threw up her arms
with a shriek fell backward insensible
mourners sprang forward
all were staring
upon the face of John
They turned away
sick and faint
One man
trying
to escape the awful sight
stumbled against the coffin
coffin fell
glass was shattered
From the opening crawled John Mortonson's cat
which
leapt to the floor
sat up
wiped its crimson muzzle
then walked
from the room
