Mitya Kuldarov
excited
flew into his parents' flat
ran through all the rooms
His parents had already gone to bed
sister was in bed
schoolboy brothers were asleep
"Where have you come from?" cried his parents
"What is the matter"
Mitya laughed
sank into an armchair
"It's because I am so delighted"
"now all Russia knows of me!"
Mitya
jumped
ran up and down all the room
sat down again
"Why, what has happened?"
"you don't read the newspapers"
"How happy I am!"
"only celebrated people"
"names are published"
"now they have"
"published mine"
"Where?"
papa turned pale
mamma glanced at the holy image
crossed herself
schoolboys jumped out of bed
went
to their brother
"Keep the paper, mamma"
"in memory of it"
"Look!"
Mitya pulled out
a copy of the paper
gave it to his father
pointed
to a passage
"Read it!"
