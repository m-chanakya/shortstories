Nearly two thousand years ago
lived in Rome
Julius Ceasar
greatest of all the Romans
brave warrior
conquered many countries
At last
made himself the ruler of Rome
Once
Ceasar was passing through a little
village
all
came out to see him
led by their mayor
mayor looked
proud and happy
Some
officers
with Ceasar laughed
"See how that fellow struts"
"head of his little flock"
Ceasar, "he has reason to be proud"
"I"
"rather be"
"head"
"of a village than"
"second man in Rome!"
another time
Ceasar was crossing
sea in
boat
halfway
a storm overtook him
seemed
as though
boat would sink
captain
trembled with fear
he could not guide the boat
But Ceasar was not afraid
bade the man
take his oars again
"The boat will not be lost"
"you have Ceasar on board"
