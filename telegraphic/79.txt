Criminal with a Crown
told his last lie
but not even his servants would believe it
made his last threat
but no living soul feared it
his last stroke of violence
fell short
When he saw
own image reflected in
eyes of men
he was afraid
and cried
"Earth swallow me!"
Earth opened
swallowed him
But so great
harm
he had wrought upon the Earth
it could not contain him
Earth opened again
spewed him forth
"Sea hide me!"
waves rolled over his head
But the Sea
could not endure him
threw him up on the shore
"Air carry me away!"
strong winds
lifted him up
But the pure Air
wherein he had let loose
vultures of hate
found the burden
intolerable
let him fall
"Fire give me a refuge!"
the Fire
wherewith he had consumed the homes of men
rejoiced
"Welcome, old master!" roared the Fire
"Be my slave!"
Then he perceived
no hope for him in the justice of the elements
he said
"I will seek mercy of Him"
"whom I have most offended"
he fled to the foot of the Great White Throne
kneeled
waiting for the sentence of the Judge of All
