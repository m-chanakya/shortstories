Henry Saylor
reporter on the Cincinnati Commercial
In
1859
vacant dwelling in Vine street
center of a local excitement
According to
many
residents of the vicinity
the house was haunted
Figures
singularly unfamiliar
seen
to pass in and out
No one could say
where they appeared
what point they vanished
no two agreed
in their descriptions of the figures
Some
ventured
to stand upon the doorsteps to intercept them
unable to force the door
hurled from the steps by some invisible agency
One day
Saylor
received a note from the city editor
"pass the night alone in the haunted house"
"if anything occurs"
"make two columns"
he effected an entrance through a rear window
walked through the deserted rooms
seating himself at last
on an old sofa
night came on
crowd had collected in the street
set open every door in the whole interior
but all the outer ones were locked
exclamations from the crowd
spring to the window
He saw
a man moving rapidly
toward the building
ascend the steps
a noise as of the opening and closing of the hall door
heavy footsteps along the passage
ascend the stairs
on the uncarpeted floor of the chamber
overhead
drew his pistol
entered the chamber
footsteps in an adjoining room
entered that
struck his foot against some object
human head
Lifting it
returned to
room below
near the window
examined it
half conscious of
opening and closing of the outer door
raised his eyes
saw himself the center of a crowd
"you see me under suspicious circumstances"
his voice was drowned in
laughter as is heard in asylums
The persons about him pointed at the object in his hand
he dropped it
They danced about it
They struck it with their feet
cursed and screamed
head
shot out of the door
followed by all
the door closed
Saylor was alone
putting away his pistol
went to a window
The street was deserted
left the house
walked to the Commercial office
editor was still in his office
asleep
Saylor waked him
"I have been at the haunted house."
"I passed the night there"
"did anything occur?"
"Nothing whatever."
