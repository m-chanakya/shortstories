good
to
observe Christmas day
But there is
better thing
that is
keeping Christmas
Are you willing
forget what you
done for other people
remember what other
have done for you
think what you owe
world
do
more than your duty
own that
reason for
existence is
what you
going to give
willing to do
for a day?
you can keep Christmas
Are you willing
believe
love
strongest thing in
world
and
the blessed life which began in Bethlehem
is the image
of
Eternal Love? Then you can keep Christmas
if you keep
for a day, why not always?
never keep it alone
