Damini
about to call Kabir when the door bell rang
"How's Nishi?" asked Damini
"She is fine"
said Kabir
Kabir was
troubled
first his sister Muskaan's untimely death
then his mother's ill
health
now his best friend Ashok's daughter's accident
within a
span of six months
"I think you need some rest"
Kabir didn't
moving
"Anything wrong?" inquired Damini
"Something strange happened" said Kabir
"What" asked Damini
"Ashok"
"thanked me because Muskaan was my sister"
as
he could not thank her himself
"why he wanted to thank Muskaan"
"because he thinks"
"Muskaan's eyes that his daughter got"
"he is not sure"
"but he was thanking"
"for her gesture"
he choked "remember how I castigated her when she said she has donated her eyes"
Damini put
hand over his shoulder to console him
"I belittled her noble gesture"
He had tears in his eyes
"Ashok's words made me realise what she meant"
"to live after death"
