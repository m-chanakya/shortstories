Lord Oakhurst lay dying
His young wife
moved about the apartment
Lord Oakhurst
thinking of days
when he wooed
his
wife
remembered how she had
first hesitated
murmured
"an old bald-beaded galoot"
but when he told her
his income was Â£50,000 a year, she threw herself on to him
Sir Everhard
famous London physician
Lady Oakhurst met him at the door
Sir Everhard
ascended the stairs
to Lord Oakhurst's apartment
Lady Oakhurst followed
Sir Everhard
pronounced
"your husband has croaked"
his meaning flashed upon her
struck open Lord Oakhurst's cabinet
opened the document
she took therefrom
with a
shriek
fell senseless
Sir Everhard
read its contents
Lord Oakhurst's will, bequeathing
his property to a scientific institution
Dropping the will, he
transferred some valuable ornaments
to his pockets
passed out into the avenue
Lord Oakhurst
kept a
kennel of curs, which
rushed
sprang upon the physician
Sir Everhard
gave vent to
CURSE
ran
to his carriage
drove off
