small girl
habit of running away
morning
Louisa May Alcott slipped out of the house
she came upon some children
going to
ash heap to play
When she tired
she bade the children good-by
wandered about
began to grow dark
threw herself down on some doorsteps
was fast asleep
town crier went by
father and mother
missed her
decided to hire this man to search
The town crier took Louisa
home
the next day
Louisa's parents
tied her to
sofa for a whole day
Louisa
felt
ashamed
made up her mind
cure herself
habit
whenever
desire to slip out
hurry to her
room
shut her eyes
make up stories
write them down
finally she told her mother about them
she advised her to keep on writing
became one of the best American storytellers
At first
paid
small sums
When the Civil War broke out
she went
as a nurse
after her return
her books began to sell
first time
great deal of money
