King Maximilian
walking in the country
stopped under a tree to rest
took
book from his pocket
to read.
Soon
fast asleep
past noon when he awoke
started for home
walked a mile or more
think of his book
left it under the tree
tired
did not like to walk back
But
did not wish to lose the book
happened to see
boy
tending
geese
went toward the boy
held a gold piece
"You shall have it if"
"run back to"
"tree"
"fetch me"
"book"
"I left there"
said the boy
"think"
"I am silly enough to believe that"
he put the gold piece into
little fellow's hand
boy said
"but I can't leave the geese"
"will tend"
"while you are away"
said the king
boy gave the king his whip
started off
came back
"Crack the whip!"
king tried
could not make a sound
gave the king lessons in whip cracking
boy again started off
geese
went
across the meadow
king ran after them
no use
boy came back with the book
"you have lost the geese"
king did as he was told
geese
driven back into the meadow
"pardon me"
said Maximilian
"as I am a king"
"not used to such work"
said the boy
"not so silly as to believe that you are a king"
"here is another gold piece"
The boy took the gold
"you might be a good king"
"would never be a good gooseherd"
