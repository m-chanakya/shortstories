In the valley of Nis
moon shines thinly
through the lethal foliage
And within the depths of the valley
move forms not meant to be beheld
Rank is the herbage
evil vines
ruined palaces
And in trees
leap little apes
poison serpents
At
very bottom of
valley lies
river Than
whose waters are slimy
From hidden springs it rises
so
Daemon of the Valley knows not why
waters are red
nor whither they are bound
Genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the Daemon of the Valley
"I am old"
"forget much"
"Tell me the deeds"
"and name of"
"who built these things of Stone"
Daemon replied
"I am Memory"
"am wise in lore of the past"
"These beings"
"not to be understood"
"Their deeds I recall not"
"Their aspect I recall dimly"
"it was like"
"that of the little apes"
"These beings"
"were called Man"
Genie flew back to
moon
Daemon looked intently at a little ape
