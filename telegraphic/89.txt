A poor Woodman was cutting down a tree
near the edge of a deep pool
the Woodman was tired
the axe slipped
flew out of his hands into the pool
The Woodman was in despair
he had not money enough to buy a new one
god Mercury suddenly appeared
asked what the trouble was
Woodman told what had happened
kind Mercury dived into the pool
When he came up again
he held a wonderful golden axe
"Is this your axe?" Mercury asked
"No," answered the honest Woodman
Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank
sprang back into the pool
he brought up an axe of silver
Woodman declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one
Mercury dived down for the third time
he came up again
he had the very axe that had been lost
Woodman was very glad
his axe had been found
Mercury was greatly pleased with the Woodman's honesty
"as a reward you may have all three axes"
The happy Woodman returned to his home with his treasures
soon the story of his good fortune was known to everybody in the village
several Woodmen
who believed that they could easily win the same good fortune
hurried out into the woods
hiding their axes
pretended they had lost them
they wept
called on Mercury
Mercury did appear
To each one he showed an axe of gold
each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost
But Mercury did not give them the golden axe
Instead he gave them each a hard whack over the head with it
sent them home
they returned next day
to look for their own axes
they were nowhere to be found
