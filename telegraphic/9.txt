There was a handful of clay in the bank of a river
only common clay
but it had high thoughts of its own value
wonderful dreams of the great place
it was to fill
the trees whispered together of the glory
when the delicate blossoms
leaves began to expand
The flowers
said
"Sisters, how lovely you have become"
The river
glad of new strength
murmured to the shores in music
the clay comforted itself
"My time will come"
One day
lifted
tossed
into a cart
carried far away
over a rough
road
"The path to glory is always rugged"
The clay was put into a trough
mixed
beaten
trampled
The clay felt sure
if it could only wait
reward was in store
put upon a swiftly turning wheel
pressed
moulded
through
the dizziness and pain
it felt
taking a new form
put
into an oven
fires
kindled about it
the clay
endured its trials
"I am intended for something very splendid"
taken from the furnace
set down upon a board
beside the board
was a pool of water
the clay saw its new shape
a common flower-pot
"Why hast thou made me thus?"
it was filled with earth
something rough and brown
thrust into the middle of the earth
"the worst of all that has happened to me"
it was set in a greenhouse
the sunlight fell
upon it
water was sprinkled over it
Something was stirring within it
a new hope
knew not what the new hope meant
One day
carried into a great church
Still it could not understand
"Why do all the people look toward us?"
"You are carrying a royal sceptre of lilies"
the clay was content
though an earthen vessel
it held so great a treasure
