Wilhelm was staying at an inn
One day
going upstairs he met a little girl
As she ran by
he caught her
asked her to whom she belonged
He felt
she must be one of the rope-dancers
She gave him a
dark look
slipped out
ran away without speaking
next time he saw her
Wilhelm spoke
"Do not be afraid of me"
"What is your name?"
"Mignon"
said the child
"How old are you?"
"No one has counted"
Wilhelm went on
but he could not help
thinking of her dark eyes
strange ways
One day
great outcry among the crowd
watching the rope-dancers
Wilhelm went
to find out
He saw
master of the dancers
beating little Mignon
He ran
held the man by the collar
"Let the child alone!" he cried
child crept away
hid herself
"Pay me what her clothes cost"
"and you may take her"
As soon as all was quiet
Wilhelm went to look for Mignon
she now belonged to him
not until the rope-dancers
left the town
she came to him
"Where have you been?" asked Wilhelm
child did not speak
"You are to live with me now"
"must be a good child"
"I will try," said Mignon
she tried to do all
she could for Wilhelm
his friends
let no one wait on him but herself
She was often seen
to wash from her face the paint
rope-dancers had reddened her cheeks
Mignon grew
lovely every day
She never walked
the stairs
but jumped
To each one she would speak in a different way
To Wilhelm
her arms crossed upon her breast
Often for a whole day she would not say one word
yet in waiting upon Wilhelm she never tired
One night he came home very weary and sad
she asked him if she might dance
"It might ease your heart"
Wilhelm
to please her
told her
she might
she brought a little carpet
each corner she placed a candle
put a number of eggs
called to a man
waiting with a violin
tied a band about her eyes
dancing began
lightly
quickly
nimbly
she moved
skipped so fast among the eggs
But not one
did she touch
Not one
moved
Wilhelm forgot all his cares
dance was ended
Wilhelm thanked her
When she had gone
man with the violin told Wilhelm of the care she had taken to teach him the music
how she had sung it
how she had even wished to pay him
another way
Mignon tried to please Wilhelm
She sang to him
song
he liked best
whose words he had never heard
He asked her to speak the words over and over
He wrote them down
"Do you know the land where citrons, lemons, grow, And oranges under the green leaves glow?"
Once
she had ended the song
said again
"Do you know the land?"
"must be Italy"
said Wilhelm
"Have you ever been there?"
child did not answer
