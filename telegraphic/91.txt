a walnut tree
grew on top of the hill
She went beyond
tree
where
grass
long
In the farmhouse
door bangs
in the road
dog barked
wagon came jolting
over the frozen road
she was lying on the grass
fragrance arose from her
young man from
neighboring farm came
across
field
climbed
fence
came to the hill but
did not see her
looked toward the house
stamping on the frozen groun
Then he knew she was there
aroma of her crept
He ran to kneel beside her
Everything was different than
other evenings
She was different
He grew bold
put his hands on her
face
neck
breasts
hips
There was a
new firmness
to her body
He had been a farm boy
plowed many acres
He plowed her deeply
planted the seeds of a son
She carried the seeds of a son within
winter evenings she went
to a barn where she milked cows
She was large
strong
Her legs went swinging
son within her went swinging
He learned the rhythm of
little hills
flat places
legs walking
strong hands pulling at
teats of cows
There was a field
barren
filled with stones
In the spring
when she was big with him she went to the fields
little stones stuck out
like the heads of buried children
They struggled to come out
struggled to come to her
brook ran over stones
its voice cried out
long time she stayed
with sorrow
She arose
went to the farmhouse
voices of the darkness cried to her as she went along
Within herself
child struggled
she got into bed
She lay still
listened
Only one small voice seemed coming
out of the silence of the night
