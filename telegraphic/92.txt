When I go into a bank I get rattled
I become an irresponsible idiot
I knew this
but my salary had been raised
I felt
bank
only place for it
So I shambled in
I had an idea
a person about to open an account must
consult the manager
I went up to a wicket marked "Accountant"
"Can I see the manager?" I said
"alone"
I don't know why I said "alone"
"Certainly"
fetched him
I held my fifty-six dollars
in a crumpled ball
"Can I see you," I asked
"alone?"
I didn't want to say "alone" again
but without it the thing seemed self-evident
manager looked at me in some alarm
He felt
I had an awful secret
led the way to a private room
turned the key in the lock
"We are safe from interruption here," he said
"You are one of Pinkerton's men, I presume," he said
He had gathered
my mysterious manner
I was a detective
"not from Pinkerton's," I said
"not a detective at all"
"come to open an account"
manager looked relieved but still serious
he concluded
I was a son of Baron Rothschild or a young Gould
"A large account, I suppose," he said
"Fairly large," I whispered
"to deposit fifty-six dollars now"
"fifty dollars a month regularly"
manager got up
opened the door
called to the accountant
"this gentleman is opening an account"
"Good morning"
I rose
A big iron door stood open
side of the room
"Good morning," I said
stepped into the safe
"Come out," said the manager coldly
showed me the other way
I went
to the accountant's wicket
poked the ball of money at him
"deposit it"
He took the money
gave it to another clerk
made me write the sum on a slip
sign my name in a book
"Is it deposited?" I asked
"It is"
"Then I want to draw a cheque"
My idea was to draw out six dollars
for present use
Someone gave me a chequebook
someone else began telling me how to write it out
I wrote something on the cheque
thrust it
at the clerk
"you drawing it all out again?" he asked in surprise
I realized
I had written fifty-six instead of six
I had a feeling
it was impossible to explain
All the clerks
stopped
to look at me
Reckless with misery
I made a plunge
"Yes"
"not going to deposit any more?" said the clerk
astonished
"Never"
An idiot hope struck me
they might think something
insulted me
I had changed my mind
I made
attempt to look like a man with
quick temper
"How will you have it?" he said
"What?"
"Oh"
I caught his meaning
answered without
trying to think
"in fifties"
"And the six?"
"In sixes"
He gave it
I rushed out
I caught the echo of a roar of laughter
Since then I bank no more
keep my money
in my
pocket
savings
in a sock
