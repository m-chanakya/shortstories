I was
very smart
at the age of thirteen
It was then
I did my first newspaper scribbling
unexpectedly
it stirred up
sensation in the community
I was very proud of it
My uncle had me on his paper
(Weekly Hannibal)
he left town
a week
asked me if
I could edit one issue of the paper
Ah! didn't I want to try! Higgins was the editor
rival paper
He had lately been jilted
one night a friend found
note on the poor fellow's bed
in which he stated
he could no longer endure life
had drowned himself in Bear Creek
friend ran down there
discovered Higgins wading back
He had concluded he wouldn't
village was full of it for several days
but Higgins did not suspect
I thought this
opportunity
wrote
wretched account of the whole matter
illustrated it
a picture of Higgins wading out
sounding the depth of the water with a walking-stick
I thought it was
funny
unconscious
there was any moral obliquity
satisfied with this effort I looked
for other worlds to conquer
it struck me
to charge the editor of a neighboring country paper with a piece of gratuitous rascality
Then I lampooned two prominent citizens
not because they
done anything to deserve
merely
to make the paper lively
Next I
touched up the newest stranger
tailor from Quincy
inveterate woman-killer
Every week he wrote
"poetry" for the journal
about his newest conquest
"We"
"let this thing pass"
"but we wish Mr. J. Gordon Runnels to understand"
"we have a character to sustain"
"from this time forth when he wants to commune with his friends"
"he must select some other medium than"
"this journal"
paper came out
Hannibal Journal was in demand
whole town was stirred
Higgins dropped in with
shotgun
found
it was an infant
that had done him the damage
pulled my ears
went away
left town for good
tailor came with his
shears
he despised me
departed for the South
two lampooned citizens came with threats of libel
went away incensed at my insignificance
country editor pranced in with a war-whoop
ended by forgiving me cordially
My uncle was very angry
unreasonably so, I thought
considering
impetus I had given the paper
But he softened when he looked at the accounts
saw
I had
booked
thirty-three new subscribers
