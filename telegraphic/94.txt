WHEN
war was over
Aunt Peggy went to Monsieur
and said
I ain't never gwine to quit yer"
"I 'm gittin' ole"
"All I axes is a li'le co'ner whar"
"wait peaceful fu de en'"
Monsieur and Madame were
touched
So
a nice cabin
was set apart
At intervals of
two years
Peggy hobbles
to the house
delivers
address which has become
familiar:
"Le' me look at you good"
"'fo' it 's too late"
After such a visit
Peggy
returns
with a generously filled apron
The scruple which Monsieur
felt in supporting a woman for so many years
has
disappeared
his attitude towards
Peggy is
one of
astonishment
wonder at the surprising age
an old black woman may attain when she sets her mind to it
