that Henry Armstrong was buried
compelled
to admit
But dead -- no
only very
ill
did not greatly concern himself
three men
digging into the grave of Henry Armstrong
Two
students from a medical college
the third
negro known as Jess
grounds farthest from the public road
horse and a light wagon, waiting
the earth with which the grave
filled
thrown out
Removal of the casket from its box
unscrewed the cover and laid it aside
Henry Armstrong
sat up
the men fled
But Jess was of another breed
morning the two students
met at the medical college
saw a horse
light wagon
near
dissecting-room
On a bench
sat the negro Jess
"my pay"
on
table lay the body of Henry Armstrong
head
defiled
from a blow with a spade
